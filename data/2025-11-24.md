### [1] [Towards Hyper-Efficient RAG Systems in VecDBs: Distributed Parallel Multi-Resolution Vector Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16681)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPI introduces a multi-resolution vector indexing framework that adaptively selects optimal resolution levels per query, achieving significant speedup and memory efficiency gains while improving retrieval quality in RAG systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vector database retrieval pipelines use flat or single-resolution indexing structures that cannot adapt to varying semantic granularity requirements of different user queries, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between retrieval speed and contextual relevance.

Method: SPI constructs a semantic pyramid over document embeddings and dynamically selects the optimal resolution level per query through a lightweight classifier, enabling progressive retrieval from coarse-to-fine representations without requiring offline tuning or separate model training.

Result: SPI achieves up to 5.7× retrieval speedup and 1.8× memory efficiency gain while improving end-to-end QA F1 scores by up to 2.5 points compared to strong baselines across multiple RAG tasks including MS MARCO, Natural Questions, and multimodal retrieval benchmarks.

Conclusion: SPI provides a compatible framework with existing VecDB infrastructures that is readily deployable in production RAG systems, offering theoretical guarantees on retrieval quality and latency bounds while significantly improving performance metrics.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become a dominant approach to augment large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, existing vector database (VecDB) retrieval pipelines rely on flat or single-resolution indexing structures, which cannot adapt to the varying semantic granularity required by diverse user queries. This limitation leads to suboptimal trade-offs between retrieval speed and contextual relevance.
  To address this, we propose \textbf{Semantic Pyramid Indexing (SPI)}, a novel multi-resolution vector indexing framework that introduces query-adaptive resolution control for RAG in VecDBs. Unlike existing hierarchical methods that require offline tuning or separate model training, SPI constructs a semantic pyramid over document embeddings and dynamically selects the optimal resolution level per query through a lightweight classifier. This adaptive approach enables progressive retrieval from coarse-to-fine representations, significantly accelerating search while maintaining semantic coverage.
  We implement SPI as a plugin for both FAISS and Qdrant backends and evaluate it across multiple RAG tasks including MS MARCO, Natural Questions, and multimodal retrieval benchmarks. SPI achieves up to \textbf{5.7$\times$} retrieval speedup and \textbf{1.8$\times$} memory efficiency gain while improving end-to-end QA F1 scores by up to \textbf{2.5 points} compared to strong baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides guarantees on retrieval quality and latency bounds, while extensive ablation studies validate the contribution of each component. The framework's compatibility with existing VecDB infrastructures makes it readily deployable in production RAG systems.

### [2] [Bench360: Benchmarking Local LLM Inference from 360°](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16682)
*Linus Stuhlmann,Mauricio Fadel Argerich,Jonathan Fürst*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bench360 is a comprehensive benchmarking framework for local LLM inference that allows users to test various models, inference engines, and quantization levels across different usage scenarios while tracking both system metrics and task-specific performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users face overwhelming configuration choices when running LLMs locally, with existing benchmarks being too narrow and not user-focused, lacking integration of system and task-specific metrics in a unified framework.

Method: Bench360 enables users to define custom tasks with datasets and metrics, then automatically benchmarks selected LLMs, inference engines, and quantization levels across different usage scenarios (single stream, batch, server) while tracking computing performance, resource usage, deployment metrics, and task-specific metrics.

Result: Evaluation on four common LLM tasks across three hardware platforms and four inference engines revealed interesting trade-offs between task performance and system-level efficiency, with no single best setup for local inference.

Conclusion: There is no universally optimal configuration for local LLM inference, strongly motivating the need for comprehensive benchmarking frameworks like Bench360 to help users make informed decisions based on their specific requirements.

Abstract: Running large language models (LLMs) locally is becoming increasingly common. While the growing availability of small open-source models and inference engines has lowered the entry barrier, users now face an overwhelming number of configuration choices. Identifying an optimal configuration -- balancing functional and non-functional requirements -- requires substantial manual effort. While several benchmarks target LLM inference, they are designed for narrow evaluation goals and not user-focused. They fail to integrate relevant system and task-specific metrics into a unified, easy-to-use benchmark that supports multiple inference engines, usage scenarios, and quantization levels. To address this gap, we present Bench360 -- Benchmarking Local LLM Inference from 360°. Bench360 allows users to easily define their own custom tasks along with datasets and relevant task-specific metrics and then automatically benchmarks selected LLMs, inference engines, and quantization levels across different usage scenarios (single stream, batch & server). Bench360 tracks a wide range of metrics, including (1) system metrics -- such as Computing Performance (e.g., latency, throughput), Resource Usage (e.g., energy per query), and Deployment (e.g., cold start time) -- and (2) task-specific metrics such as ROUGE, F1 score or accuracy. We demonstrate Bench360 on four common LLM tasks -- General Knowledge & Reasoning, QA, Summarization and Text-to-SQL -- across three hardware platforms and four state of the art inference engines. Our results reveal several interesting trade-offs between task performance and system-level efficiency, highlighting the differences in inference engines and models. Most importantly, there is no single best setup for local inference, which strongly motivates the need for a framework such as Bench360.

### [3] [How Well Do LLMs Understand Tunisian Arabic?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16683)
*Mohamed Mahdi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study benchmarks popular LLMs on Tunisian Arabic (Tunizi) tasks including transliteration, translation, and sentiment analysis, revealing significant performance gaps and advocating for better inclusion of low-resource languages in AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial-scale LLMs often overlook low-resource languages like Tunisian Arabic, risking exclusion of millions of Tunisians from AI interaction in their native language and threatening cultural preservation and literacy.

Method: Created a novel parallel dataset with Tunizi, standard Tunisian Arabic, and English translations plus sentiment labels, then benchmarked several popular LLMs on transliteration, translation, and sentiment analysis tasks.

Result: Results revealed significant performance differences between models, highlighting both strengths and limitations in understanding and processing Tunisian dialects.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of including low-resource languages in next-generation AI systems to ensure technology remains accessible, inclusive, and culturally grounded.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are the engines driving today's AI agents. The better these models understand human languages, the more natural and user-friendly the interaction with AI becomes, from everyday devices like computers and smartwatches to any tool that can act intelligently. Yet, the ability of industrial-scale LLMs to comprehend low-resource languages, such as Tunisian Arabic (Tunizi), is often overlooked. This neglect risks excluding millions of Tunisians from fully interacting with AI in their own language, pushing them toward French or English. Such a shift not only threatens the preservation of the Tunisian dialect but may also create challenges for literacy and influence younger generations to favor foreign languages. In this study, we introduce a novel dataset containing parallel Tunizi, standard Tunisian Arabic, and English translations, along with sentiment labels. We benchmark several popular LLMs on three tasks: transliteration, translation, and sentiment analysis. Our results reveal significant differences between models, highlighting both their strengths and limitations in understanding and processing Tunisian dialects. By quantifying these gaps, this work underscores the importance of including low-resource languages in the next generation of AI systems, ensuring technology remains accessible, inclusive, and culturally grounded.

### [4] [Ellipsoid-Based Decision Boundaries for Open Intent Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16685)
*Yuetian Zou,Hanlei Zhang,Hua Xu,Songze Li,Long Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EliDecide is a novel method for textual open intent classification that learns ellipsoid decision boundaries with varying scales along different feature directions, outperforming existing spherical boundary approaches on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adaptive decision boundary methods assume isotropic distributions of known classes, restricting boundaries to spherical shapes and overlooking distributional variance along different directions, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Method: The method uses supervised contrastive learning for discriminative features, learnable matrices to parameterize ellipsoid boundaries for each known class, and optimizes boundaries via a dual loss function balancing empirical and open-space risks.

Result: EliDecide achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple text intent benchmarks and a question classification dataset, demonstrating superior open intent detection capability.

Conclusion: The flexibility of ellipsoid boundaries shows strong potential for generalization to more text classification tasks in diverse complex open-world scenarios.

Abstract: Textual open intent classification is crucial for real-world dialogue systems, enabling robust detection of unknown user intents without prior knowledge and contributing to the robustness of the system. While adaptive decision boundary methods have shown great potential by eliminating manual threshold tuning, existing approaches assume isotropic distributions of known classes, restricting boundaries to balls and overlooking distributional variance along different directions. To address this limitation, we propose EliDecide, a novel method that learns ellipsoid decision boundaries with varying scales along different feature directions. First, we employ supervised contrastive learning to obtain a discriminative feature space for known samples. Second, we apply learnable matrices to parameterize ellipsoids as the boundaries of each known class, offering greater flexibility than spherical boundaries defined solely by centers and radii. Third, we optimize the boundaries via a novelly designed dual loss function that balances empirical and open-space risks: expanding boundaries to cover known samples while contracting them against synthesized pseudo-open samples. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple text intent benchmarks and further on a question classification dataset. The flexibility of the ellipsoids demonstrates superior open intent detection capability and strong potential for generalization to more text classification tasks in diverse complex open-world scenarios.

### [5] [Prompt-Based Value Steering of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16688)
*Giulio Antonio Abbo,Tony Belpaeme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to evaluate how effectively prompts can steer language model responses toward specific human values, using Schwartz's theory of basic human values and showing that value steering is possible without model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning approaches for aligning language models with human values are static and don't adapt to dynamic values and preferences in everyday situations, creating a need for more flexible steering methods.

Method: Developed a practical, reproducible, model-agnostic procedure to evaluate prompt effectiveness in steering text toward human values, using Schwartz's theory of basic human values and structured evaluation through dialogue datasets.

Result: Applied the method to a Wizard-Vicuna language model variant and demonstrated that value steering is achievable even without model alterations or dynamic prompt optimization, showing improved alignment with target values.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective way to steer language model responses toward specific human values using carefully designed prompts, offering a flexible alternative to static fine-tuning approaches.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in applications where alignment with human values is critical. While model fine-tuning is often employed to ensure safe responses, this technique is static and does not lend itself to everyday situations involving dynamic values and preferences. In this paper, we present a practical, reproducible, and model-agnostic procedure to evaluate whether a prompt candidate can effectively steer generated text toward specific human values, formalising a scoring method to quantify the presence and gain of target values in generated responses. We apply our method to a variant of the Wizard-Vicuna language model, using Schwartz's theory of basic human values and a structured evaluation through a dialogue dataset. With this setup, we compare a baseline prompt to one explicitly conditioned on values, and show that value steering is possible even without altering the model or dynamically optimising prompts.

### [6] [Concept-Based Interpretability for Toxicity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16689)
*Samarth Garg,Deeksha Varshney,Divya Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an interpretability technique using Concept Gradient (CG) to address classification errors in toxicity detection caused by disproportionate concept attribution, and proposes lexicon-free augmentation to analyze model attribution patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited exploration of concept-based explanations in toxicity detection, and the problem of disproportionate concept attribution leading to classification errors in existing models.

Method: Leverages toxicity subtype attributes as concepts, introduces Concept Gradient (CG) method for causal interpretation, creates Targeted Lexicon Set to capture misclassification-causing words, computes Word-Concept Alignment (WCA) scores, and implements lexicon-free augmentation by generating toxic samples without predefined toxic lexicon sets.

Result: The approach provides more causal interpretation of model decisions and helps identify when over-attribution to toxic concepts causes classification errors, even when explicit lexical overlap is removed.

Conclusion: The proposed interpretability framework and lexicon-free augmentation strategy offer valuable insights into model attribution patterns in toxicity detection, addressing the limitations of traditional feature-based methods and improving understanding of classification errors.

Abstract: The rise of social networks has not only facilitated communication but also allowed the spread of harmful content. Although significant advances have been made in detecting toxic language in textual data, the exploration of concept-based explanations in toxicity detection remains limited. In this study, we leverage various subtype attributes present in toxicity detection datasets, such as obscene, threat, insult, identity attack, and sexual explicit as concepts that serve as strong indicators to identify whether language is toxic. However, disproportionate attribution of concepts towards the target class often results in classification errors. Our work introduces an interpretability technique based on the Concept Gradient (CG) method which provides a more causal interpretation by measuring how changes in concepts directly affect the output of the model. This is an extension of traditional gradient-based methods in machine learning, which often focus solely on input features. We propose the curation of Targeted Lexicon Set, which captures toxic words that contribute to misclassifications in text classification models. To assess the significance of these lexicon sets in misclassification, we compute Word-Concept Alignment (WCA) scores, which quantify the extent to which these words lead to errors due to over-attribution to toxic concepts. Finally, we introduce a lexicon-free augmentation strategy by generating toxic samples that exclude predefined toxic lexicon sets. This approach allows us to examine whether over-attribution persists when explicit lexical overlap is removed, providing insights into the model's attribution on broader toxic language patterns.

### [7] [Falsely Accused: How AI Detectors Misjudge Slightly Polished Arabic Articles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16690)
*Saleh Almohaimeed,Saad Almohaimeed,Mousa Jari,Khaled A. Alobaid,Fahad Alotaibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI detectors misclassify slightly polished human-authored Arabic articles as AI-generated, with performance dropping significantly - from 92% to 12% accuracy for commercial models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem where AI detectors falsely classify human-authored articles that have been slightly polished by AI as AI-generated, leading to false plagiarism accusations and undermining detector credibility, particularly in Arabic where this issue hasn't been studied.

Method: Created two Arabic datasets: one with 800 articles (half AI/half human) to evaluate 14 LLMs and commercial detectors, and another (Ar-APT) with 400 human articles polished by 10 LLMs using 4 settings (16,400 samples) to test if slight polishing affects detection accuracy.

Result: All AI detectors incorrectly attributed significant numbers of polished human articles to AI. Claude-4 Sonnet dropped from 83.51% to 57.63% accuracy for LLaMA-3 polished articles. Originality.AI dropped from 92% to 12% accuracy for Mistral/Gemma-3 polished articles.

Conclusion: Slight AI polishing of human-authored Arabic text severely degrades AI detection performance, causing false positives and undermining detector reliability, highlighting a critical vulnerability in current detection systems.

Abstract: Many AI detection models have been developed to counter the presence of articles created by artificial intelligence (AI). However, if a human-authored article is slightly polished by AI, a shift will occur in the borderline decision of these AI detection models, leading them to consider it AI-generated article. This misclassification may result in falsely accusing authors of AI plagiarism and harm the credibility of AI detector models. In English, some efforts were made to meet this challenge, but not in Arabic. In this paper, we generated two datasets. The first dataset contains 800 Arabic articles, half AI-generated and half human-authored. We used it to evaluate 14 Large Language models (LLMs) and commercial AI detectors to assess their ability in distinguishing between human-authored and AI-generated articles. The best 8 models were chosen to act as detectors for our primary concern, which is whether they would consider slightly polished human text as AI-generated. The second dataset, Ar-APT, contains 400 Arabic human-authored articles polished by 10 LLMs using 4 polishing settings, totaling 16400 samples. We use it to evaluate the 8 nominated models and determine whether slight polishing will affect their performance. The results reveal that all AI detectors incorrectly attribute a significant number of articles to AI. The best performing LLM, Claude-4 Sonnet, achieved 83.51%, their performance decreased to 57.63% for articles slightly polished by LLaMA-3. Whereas for the best performing commercial model, originality.AI, that achieves 92% accuracy, dropped to 12% for articles slightly polished by Mistral or Gemma-3.

### [8] [Reproducibility Report: Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16691)
*Boyang Zhou,Johan Lindqvist,Lindsey Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reproduction study confirms test-time training with nearest neighbors reduces perplexity across multiple LLMs, with largest gains on structured datasets and models not pre-trained on similar data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate the effectiveness of test-time training using nearest neighbors for LLM adaptation and explore practical implementation considerations for large-scale retrieval.

Method: Used pretrained RoBERTa embeddings with Faiss indexing to retrieve 20 neighbors per test input, applied one gradient update per neighbor across GPT-2 (117M, 774M), GPT-Neo (1.3B), and R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B models.

Result: Test-time training significantly reduced perplexity and bits-per-byte metrics across diverse domains, with largest improvements on structured datasets like GitHub and EuroParl. Models not pre-trained on The Pile benefited more, allowing smaller models to approach larger model performance.

Conclusion: Nearest-neighbor test-time training is robust and generalizable, with consistent gains even for modern reasoning-optimized architectures. Practical memory-efficient retrieval implementation enables large-scale deployment.

Abstract: We reproduce the central claims of Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models (Hardt and Sun, 2024), which proposes adapting a language model at inference time by fine-tuning on retrieved nearest-neighbor sequences. Using pretrained RoBERTa embeddings indexed with Faiss, we retrieve 20 neighbors per test input and apply one gradient update per neighbor across GPT-2 (117M, 774M), GPT-Neo (1.3B), and R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B. Our experiments confirm that test-time training significantly reduces perplexity and bits-per-byte metrics across diverse domains from The Pile, with the largest improvements in structured or specialized datasets such as GitHub and EuroParl. We further validate that models not pretrained on The Pile benefit more from this adaptation than models already trained on similar data, allowing smaller models to approach the performance of larger ones. Due to infrastructure limitations, we introduce a memory-efficient retrieval implementation that loads only required line offsets rather than entire files, reducing RAM requirements from over 128 GB per server to 32 GB. We also extend the original study by evaluating R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B, showing that test-time training yields consistent gains even for modern reasoning-optimized architectures. Overall, our results support the robustness and generality of nearest-neighbor test-time training while highlighting practical considerations for reproducing large-scale retrieval-augmented adaptation.

### [9] [How Language Directions Align with Token Geometry in Multilingual LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16693)
*JaeSeong Kim,Suan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multilingual LLMs sharply separate language information in the first transformer layer and maintain linear separability throughout depth, with language-vocabulary alignment strongly influenced by training data composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited systematic analysis of how language information is structured in multilingual LLMs' internal representations and how it emerges across layers.

Method: Comprehensive probing study on six multilingual LLMs covering 268 transformer layers using linear/nonlinear probes and Token-Language Alignment analysis to quantify layer-wise dynamics and geometric structure.

Result: Language information becomes sharply separated in first transformer block (+76.4±8.2 percentage points) and remains linearly separable. Chinese-inclusive models achieve 16.43% ZH Match@Peak vs 3.90% for English-centric models (4.21× structural imprinting effect).

Conclusion: Multilingual LLMs distinguish languages by latent representational structures shaped by training corpus, not surface script features. Findings provide insights for data composition strategies and fairness in multilingual representation learning.

Abstract: Multilingual LLMs demonstrate strong performance across diverse languages, yet there has been limited systematic analysis of how language information is structured within their internal representation space and how it emerges across layers. We conduct a comprehensive probing study on six multilingual LLMs, covering all 268 transformer layers, using linear and nonlinear probes together with a new Token--Language Alignment analysis to quantify the layer-wise dynamics and geometric structure of language encoding. Our results show that language information becomes sharply separated in the first transformer block (+76.4$\pm$8.2 percentage points from Layer 0 to 1) and remains almost fully linearly separable throughout model depth. We further find that the alignment between language directions and vocabulary embeddings is strongly tied to the language composition of the training data. Notably, Chinese-inclusive models achieve a ZH Match@Peak of 16.43\%, whereas English-centric models achieve only 3.90\%, revealing a 4.21$\times$ structural imprinting effect. These findings indicate that multilingual LLMs distinguish languages not by surface script features but by latent representational structures shaped by the training corpus. Our analysis provides practical insights for data composition strategies and fairness in multilingual representation learning.

### [10] [Hierarchical Retrieval with Out-Of-Vocabulary Queries: A Case Study on SNOMED CT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16698)
*Jonathon Dilworth,Hui Yang,Jiaoyan Chen,Yongsheng Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a language model-based ontology embedding approach for hierarchical concept retrieval from SNOMED CT, specifically addressing out-of-vocabulary (OOV) queries that have no direct matches in the ontology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge retrieval in SNOMED CT is challenging due to language ambiguity, synonyms, and polysemies, which is exacerbated when queries are out-of-vocabulary (OOV) with no equivalent matches in the ontology.

Method: The authors propose an approach based on language model-based ontology embeddings to handle hierarchical concept retrieval from SNOMED CT with OOV queries.

Result: The method outperforms baselines including SBERT and two lexical matching methods when tested on constructed OOV queries annotated against SNOMED CT concepts, particularly for retrieving direct subsumers and less relevant ancestors.

Conclusion: While evaluated against SNOMED CT, the approach is generalizable and can be extended to other ontologies. The authors release code, tools, and evaluation datasets publicly.

Abstract: SNOMED CT is a biomedical ontology with a hierarchical representation of large-scale concepts. Knowledge retrieval in SNOMED CT is critical for its application, but often proves challenging due to language ambiguity, synonyms, polysemies and so on. This problem is exacerbated when the queries are out-of-vocabulary (OOV), i.e., having no equivalent matchings in the ontology. In this work, we focus on the problem of hierarchical concept retrieval from SNOMED CT with OOV queries, and propose an approach based on language model-based ontology embeddings. For evaluation, we construct OOV queries annotated against SNOMED CT concepts, testing the retrieval of the most direct subsumers and their less relevant ancestors. We find that our method outperforms the baselines including SBERT and two lexical matching methods. While evaluated against SNOMED CT, the approach is generalisable and can be extended to other ontologies. We release code, tools, and evaluation datasets at https://github.com/jonathondilworth/HR-OOV.

### [11] [Detecting and Steering LLMs' Empathy in Action](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16699)
*Juan P. Cadile*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Empathy-in-action is identified as a linear direction in LLM activation space, with high detection accuracy across models but varying steering capabilities - some models maintain bidirectional control while others only work for empathy enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether empathy-in-action (willingness to sacrifice task efficiency for human needs) can be detected and steered as a linear direction in LLM activation space, and understand how safety training affects these capabilities.

Method: Used contrastive prompts from Empathy-in-Action benchmark to test detection and steering across three models: Phi-3-mini-4k, safety-trained Qwen2.5-7B, and uncensored Dolphin-Llama-3.1-8B. Applied activation steering techniques.

Result: Detection: All models achieved near-perfect AUROC (0.996-1.00). Phi-3 probes correlated strongly with behavioral scores (r=0.71). Cross-model agreement was limited. Steering: Qwen (65.3%) and Phi-3 (61.7%) showed bidirectional control, while Dolphin had 94.4% pro-empathy success but catastrophic failure for anti-empathy steering.

Conclusion: Empathy encoding emerges independently of safety training. Models show architecture-specific implementations despite convergent detection. Safety training may affect steering robustness rather than preventing manipulation, with validation needed across more models.

Abstract: We investigate empathy-in-action -- the willingness to sacrifice task efficiency to address human needs -- as a linear direction in LLM activation space. Using contrastive prompts grounded in the Empathy-in-Action (EIA) benchmark, we test detection and steering across Phi-3-mini-4k (3.8B), Qwen2.5-7B (safety-trained), and Dolphin-Llama-3.1-8B (uncensored).
  Detection: All models show AUROC 0.996-1.00 at optimal layers. Uncensored Dolphin matches safety-trained models, demonstrating empathy encoding emerges independent of safety training. Phi-3 probes correlate strongly with EIA behavioral scores (r=0.71, p<0.01). Cross-model probe agreement is limited (Qwen: r=-0.06, Dolphin: r=0.18), revealing architecture-specific implementations despite convergent detection.
  Steering: Qwen achieves 65.3% success with bidirectional control and coherence at extreme interventions. Phi-3 shows 61.7% success with similar coherence. Dolphin exhibits asymmetric steerability: 94.4% success for pro-empathy steering but catastrophic breakdown for anti-empathy (empty outputs, code artifacts).
  Implications: The detection-steering gap varies by model. Qwen and Phi-3 maintain bidirectional coherence; Dolphin shows robustness only for empathy enhancement. Safety training may affect steering robustness rather than preventing manipulation, though validation across more models is needed.

### [12] [NALA_MAINZ at BLP-2025 Task 2: A Multi-agent Approach for Bangla Instruction to Python Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16787)
*Hossain Shaikh Saadi,Faria Alam,Mario Sanz-Guerrero,Minh Duc Bui,Manuel Mager,Katharina von der Wense*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JGU Mainz's winning system for BLP-2025 Code Generation from Bangla Instructions uses a multi-agent pipeline where a code generator creates initial solutions, and a debugger agent fixes failing test cases, achieving 95.4% Pass@1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective system for code generation from Bangla instructions that can automatically debug and correct generated code when it fails unit tests.

Method: Multi-agent pipeline with code-generation agent producing initial solutions, followed by debugger agent that analyzes failing test cases and error messages to generate revised solutions.

Result: Achieved first place in the BLP-2025 Shared Task with a Pass@1 score of 95.4%.

Conclusion: The multi-agent approach combining code generation with targeted debugging based on test failures is highly effective for automated code generation from natural language instructions.

Abstract: This paper presents JGU Mainz's winning system for the BLP-2025 Shared Task on Code Generation from Bangla Instructions. We propose a multi-agent-based pipeline. First, a code-generation agent produces an initial solution from the input instruction. The candidate program is then executed against the provided unit tests (pytest-style, assert-based). Only the failing cases are forwarded to a debugger agent, which reruns the tests, extracts error traces, and, conditioning on the error messages, the current program, and the relevant test cases, generates a revised solution. Using this approach, our submission achieved first place in the shared task with a $Pass@1$ score of 95.4. We also make our code public.

### [13] [From Representation to Enactment: The ABC Framework of the Translating Mind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16811)
*Michael Carl,Takanori Mizowaki,Aishvarya Raj,Masaru Yamada,Devi Sri Bandaru,Yuxiang Wei,Xinyue Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a non-representational ABC framework for translation, viewing it as an enacted activity integrating affective, behavioral, and cognitive processes through brain-body-environment interactions rather than static representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an alternative to representation-based models of the mind by building on Extended Mind theory and radical enactivism, challenging traditional views of translation as manipulation of interlingual correspondences.

Method: Develops a novel ABC (affective, behavioral, cognitive) framework of the translating mind, drawing on Predictive Processing and (En)Active Inference theories to conceptualize translation as dynamically integrated processes.

Result: The framework shows that the translator's mind emerges through brain-body-environment interaction loops rather than being merely extended, reframing translation as skillful participation in sociocultural practice.

Conclusion: Translation is redefined as real-time co-creation of meaning through embodied interaction with texts, tools, and contexts, moving beyond representational models to an enacted, participatory understanding of the translating mind.

Abstract: Building on the Extended Mind (EM) theory and radical enactivism, this article suggests an alternative to representation-based models of the mind. We lay out a novel ABC framework of the translating mind, in which translation is not the manipulation of static interlingual correspondences but an enacted activity, dynamically integrating affective, behavioral, and cognitive (ABC) processes. Drawing on Predictive Processing and (En)Active Inference, we argue that the translator's mind emerges, rather than being merely extended, through loops of brain-body-environment interactions. This non-representational account reframes translation as skillful participation in sociocultural practice, where meaning is co-created in real time through embodied interaction with texts, tools, and contexts.

### [14] [Interpretable dimensions support an effect of agentivity and telicity on split intransitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16824)
*Eva Neu,Brian Dillon,Katrin Erk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper revisits the relationship between intransitive verb classes (unergatives vs. unaccusatives) and semantic properties (agentivity vs. telicity), challenging recent findings that human ratings poorly predict syntactic behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To re-examine the connection between unergativity/unaccusativity and agentivity/telicity using interpretable dimensions derived from seed words, addressing limitations in human rating tasks for evaluating these semantic properties.

Method: Using interpretable dimensions computed from seed words on opposite poles of the agentive and telic scales, in conjunction with human judgments.

Result: The findings support the link between unergativity/unaccusativity and agentivity/telicity, contrary to recent work by Kim et al. (2024).

Conclusion: Interpretable dimensions combined with human judgments provide valuable evidence for semantic properties that are difficult to evaluate through rating tasks alone, confirming the theoretical link between verb syntax and semantics.

Abstract: Intransitive verbs fall into two different syntactic classes, unergatives and unaccusatives. It has long been argued that verbs describing an agentive action are more likely to appear in an unergative syntax, and those describing a telic event to appear in an unaccusative syntax. However, recent work by Kim et al. (2024) found that human ratings for agentivity and telicity were a poor predictor of the syntactic behavior of intransitives. Here we revisit this question using interpretable dimensions, computed from seed words on opposite poles of the agentive and telic scales. Our findings support the link between unergativity/unaccusativity and agentivity/telicity, and demonstrate that using interpretable dimensions in conjunction with human judgments can offer valuable evidence for semantic properties that are not easily evaluated in rating tasks.

### [15] [PEPPER: Perception-Guided Perturbation for Robust Backdoor Defense in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16830)
*Oscar Chew,Po-Yi Lu,Jayden Lin,Kuan-Hao Huang,Hsuan-Tien Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PEPPER is a backdoor defense method for text-to-image diffusion models that rewrites input prompts to disrupt embedded triggers while maintaining visual similarity, achieving enhanced robustness against attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks where triggers in input prompts can steer generation toward harmful content, requiring effective defense mechanisms.

Method: PEPPER rewrites captions into semantically distant but visually similar versions while adding unobstructive elements to disrupt triggers and dilute trigger token influence.

Result: Experiments show PEPPER is particularly effective against text encoder based attacks, substantially reducing attack success while preserving generation quality, and can be paired with existing defenses for stronger robustness.

Conclusion: PEPPER provides an effective defense against backdoor attacks in T2I models, offering enhanced robustness that can be combined with other methods for generalizable protection.

Abstract: Recent studies show that text to image (T2I) diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where a trigger in the input prompt can steer generation toward harmful or unintended content. To address this, we introduce PEPPER (PErcePtion Guided PERturbation), a backdoor defense that rewrites the caption into a semantically distant yet visually similar caption while adding unobstructive elements. With this rewriting strategy, PEPPER disrupt the trigger embedded in the input prompt, dilute the influence of trigger tokens and thereby achieve enhanced robustness. Experiments show that PEPPER is particularly effective against text encoder based attacks, substantially reducing attack success while preserving generation quality. Beyond this, PEPPER can be paired with any existing defenses yielding consistently stronger and generalizable robustness than any standalone method. Our code will be released on Github.

*Seyed Mohssen Ghafari,Ronny Kol,Juan C. Quiroz,Nella Luan,Monika Patial,Chanaka Rupasinghe,Herman Wandabwa,Luiz Pizzato*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel reference-free metric for evaluating LLM response conciseness that uses three compression-based calculations without requiring gold standard references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate verbose responses with redundant details, reducing clarity and user satisfaction while increasing costs for model developers who charge per output token.

Method: Quantifies non-essential content by averaging three calculations: compression ratio with abstractive summary, compression ratio with extractive summary, and word-removal compression where an LLM removes non-essential words while preserving meaning.

Result: Experimental results show the metric effectively identifies redundancy in LLM outputs and provides a practical tool for automated evaluation of response brevity.

Conclusion: The proposed metric offers a practical solution for evaluating LLM response conciseness without requiring ground truth human annotations, making it suitable for conversational AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate responses that are lengthy and verbose, filled with redundant or unnecessary details. This diminishes clarity and user satisfaction, and it increases costs for model developers, especially with well-known proprietary models that charge based on the number of output tokens. In this paper, we introduce a novel reference-free metric for evaluating the conciseness of responses generated by LLMs. Our method quantifies non-essential content without relying on gold standard references and calculates the average of three calculations: i) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM abstractive summary; ii) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM extractive summary; and iii) wordremoval compression, where an LLM removes as many non-essential words as possible from the response while preserving its meaning, with the number of tokens removed indicating the conciseness score. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed metric identifies redundancy in LLM outputs, offering a practical tool for automated evaluation of response brevity in conversational AI systems without the need for ground truth human annotations.

### [17] [Improving Latent Reasoning in LLMs via Soft Concept Mixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16885)
*Kang Wang,Xiangyu Duan,Tianyi Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Soft Concept Mixing (SCM) bridges the gap between LLMs' discrete token training and soft concept reasoning by mixing soft concept vectors into hidden states during training, improving reasoning performance on five benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs reason with discrete tokens which limits expressive power compared to human abstract reasoning. There's a gap between soft concepts in reasoning and discrete tokens in training that needs to be addressed.

Method: SCM constructs soft concept vectors as probability-weighted averages of embeddings, mixes them into model's hidden states, and optimizes the latent reasoning process with Reinforcement Learning.

Result: Experiments on five reasoning benchmarks show SCM improves LLMs' reasoning performance while maintaining stable training dynamics.

Conclusion: SCM effectively bridges the training-reasoning gap by exposing models to soft representations during training, enhancing reasoning capabilities without compromising training stability.

Abstract: Unlike human reasoning in abstract conceptual spaces, large language models (LLMs) typically reason by generating discrete tokens, which potentially limit their expressive power. The recent work Soft Thinking has shown that LLMs' latent reasoning via soft concepts is a promising direction, but LLMs are trained on discrete tokens. To reduce this gap between the soft concepts in reasoning and the discrete tokens in training, we propose Soft Concept Mixing (SCM), a soft concept aware training scheme that directly exposes the model to soft representations during training. Specifically, SCM constructs a soft concept vector by forming a probability-weighted average of embeddings. Then, this vector is mixed into the model's hidden states, which embody rich contextual information. Finally, the entire latent reasoning process is optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experiments on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SCM improves the reasoning performance of LLMs, and simultaneously maintains a stable training dynamic.

TL;DR: A novel training scheme for Tiny Recursive Models (TRMs) that frames latent reasoning as classifier-free guidance, achieving 18x reduction in forward passes while maintaining performance comparable to standard TRMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of small, looped architectures like TRMs that outperform LLMs on complex reasoning tasks, with minimal changes to the architecture.

Method: Framing latent reasoning as classifier-free guidance and implicit policy improvement, then proposing a training scheme that provides targets for each loop during training, eliminating the need for halting mechanisms.

Result: 18x reduction in total forward passes, elimination of halting mechanisms, 24% accuracy on ARC-1 with only 0.8M parameters, outperforming most LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed training scheme significantly enhances TRM efficiency while maintaining reasoning quality, demonstrating that small models can achieve competitive performance on complex reasoning tasks with optimized training approaches.

Abstract: Recently, it was shown that small, looped architectures, such as Tiny Recursive Models (TRMs), can outperform Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, including the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this work, we investigate a core question: how can we further improve the efficiency of these methods with minimal changes? To address this, we frame the latent reasoning of TRMs as a form of classifier-free guidance and implicit policy improvement algorithm. Building on these insights, we propose a novel training scheme that provides a target for each loop during training. We demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances training efficiency. Our method reduces the total number of forward passes by 18x and eliminates halting mechanisms, while maintaining quality comparable to standard TRMs. Notably, we achieve 24% accuracy on ARC-1 with only 0.8M parameters, outperforming most LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates how statistical properties of training data affect induction head formation in language models, finding that bigram repetition frequency and reliability determine IH formation with a precise Pareto frontier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the precise relationship between training data statistics and the formation of induction heads, which are crucial for in-context learning capabilities in language models.

Method: Analyzed the relationship between statistical properties of training data (natural and synthetic) and induction head formation, examining batch size, context size, bigram repetition frequency, and reliability.

Result: Found that: (1) batch size and context size predict IH formation point; (2) bigram repetition frequency and reliability strongly affect IH formation with a precise Pareto frontier; (3) local dependency with high frequency/reliability is sufficient, while low values require categoricality and marginal distribution shape.

Conclusion: Statistical properties of training data, particularly bigram repetition frequency and reliability, play a crucial role in induction head formation, with specific thresholds and dependencies identified.

Abstract: Arguably, specialized attention heads dubbed induction heads (IHs) underlie the remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of modern language models (LMs); yet, a precise characterization of their formation remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the relationship between statistical properties of training data (for both natural and synthetic data) and IH formation. We show that (1) a simple equation combining batch size and context size predicts the point at which IHs form; (2) surface bigram repetition frequency and reliability strongly affect the formation of IHs, and we find a precise Pareto frontier in terms of these two values; and (3) local dependency with high bigram repetition frequency and reliability is sufficient for IH formation, but when the frequency and reliability are low, categoriality and the shape of the marginal distribution matter.

### [20] [ARQUSUMM: Argument-aware Quantitative Summarization of Online Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16985)
*An Quang Tang,Xiuzhen Zhang,Minh Ngoc Dinh,Zhuang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARQUSUMM is a novel framework for argument-aware quantitative summarization that identifies claim-reason structures in online conversations and measures argument strength through quantitative analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conversation summarization methods fail to capture the deeper argument structure within sentences and quantify argument strength, which is crucial for understanding controversial discussions on platforms like Reddit.

Method: ARQUSUMM uses LLM few-shot learning grounded in argumentation theory to identify propositions and claim-reason relationships within sentences, then employs argument structure-aware clustering to aggregate arguments and quantify their support.

Result: Experiments show ARQUSUMM outperforms existing conversation and quantitative summarization models, generating summaries with better argument structure representation, higher textual quality, and more accurate quantification.

Conclusion: The proposed argument-aware quantitative summarization framework successfully reveals claim-reason structures and measures argument strength, providing more helpful summaries for understanding online conversations.

Abstract: Online conversations have become more prevalent on public discussion platforms (e.g. Reddit). With growing controversial topics, it is desirable to summarize not only diverse arguments, but also their rationale and justification. Early studies on text summarization focus on capturing general salient information in source documents, overlooking the argumentative nature of online conversations. Recent research on conversation summarization although considers the argumentative relationship among sentences, fail to explicate deeper argument structure within sentences for summarization. In this paper, we propose a novel task of argument-aware quantitative summarization to reveal the claim-reason structure of arguments in conversations, with quantities measuring argument strength. We further propose ARQUSUMM, a novel framework to address the task. To reveal the underlying argument structure within sentences, ARQUSUMM leverages LLM few-shot learning grounded in the argumentation theory to identify propositions within sentences and their claim-reason relationships. For quantitative summarization, ARQUSUMM employs argument structure-aware clustering algorithms to aggregate arguments and quantify their support. Experiments show that ARQUSUMM outperforms existing conversation and quantitative summarization models and generate summaries representing argument structures that are more helpful to users, of high textual quality and quantification accuracy.

*Junjie Hao,Chun Wang,Ying Qiao,Qiuyue Zuo,Qiya Song,Hua Ma,Xieping Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study proposes a supervised fine-tuning approach to enhance domain-specific information extraction for Hunan's historical celebrities using large language models, achieving significant performance improvements and demonstrating cost-effective potential for cultural heritage knowledge extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of systematic data resources for Hunan's historical celebrities and the underperformance of general-purpose models in domain knowledge extraction and structured output generation in low-resource settings.

Method: Design a fine-grained, schema-guided instruction template for Hunan historical celebrities domain, build an instruction-tuning dataset, and apply parameter-efficient instruction fine-tuning to four large language models (Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) with evaluation criteria for extraction performance.

Result: All models showed substantial performance gains after fine-tuning, with Qwen3-8B achieving the strongest results (score of 89.3866 with 100 samples and 50 training iterations).

Conclusion: The study provides new insights into fine-tuning vertical large language models for regional historical and cultural domains and highlights their potential for cost-effective applications in cultural heritage knowledge extraction and knowledge graph construction.

Abstract: Large language models and knowledge graphs offer strong potential for advancing research on historical culture by supporting the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of cultural heritage. Using Hunan's modern historical celebrities shaped by Huxiang culture as a case study, pre-trained large models can help researchers efficiently extract key information, including biographical attributes, life events, and social relationships, from textual sources and construct structured knowledge graphs. However, systematic data resources for Hunan's historical celebrities remain limited, and general-purpose models often underperform in domain knowledge extraction and structured output generation in such low-resource settings. To address these issues, this study proposes a supervised fine-tuning approach for enhancing domain-specific information extraction. First, we design a fine-grained, schema-guided instruction template tailored to the Hunan historical celebrities domain and build an instruction-tuning dataset to mitigate the lack of domain-specific training corpora. Second, we apply parameter-efficient instruction fine-tuning to four publicly available large language models - Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct - and develop evaluation criteria for assessing their extraction performance. Experimental results show that all models exhibit substantial performance gains after fine-tuning. Among them, Qwen3-8B achieves the strongest results, reaching a score of 89.3866 with 100 samples and 50 training iterations. This study provides new insights into fine-tuning vertical large language models for regional historical and cultural domains and highlights their potential for cost-effective applications in cultural heritage knowledge extraction and knowledge graph construction.

### [22] [Do Vision-Language Models Understand Visual Persuasiveness?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17036)
*Gyuwon Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether vision-language models (VLMs) truly understand visual persuasion by creating a dataset for persuasiveness judgment and analyzing how VLMs perform across different persuasive factors and intervention strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if current VLMs genuinely comprehend how visual cues influence human attitudes and decisions, despite their impressive multi-modal reasoning capabilities.

Method: Constructed a high-consensus dataset for binary persuasiveness judgment, introduced Visual Persuasive Factors (VPFs) taxonomy (low-level perceptual, mid-level compositional, high-level semantic cues), and explored cognitive steering and knowledge injection strategies for persuasion reasoning.

Result: VLMs show recall-oriented bias (over-predicting high persuasiveness) and weak discriminative power for low/mid-level features. High-level semantic alignment between message and object presence is the strongest predictor of human judgment. Simple instructions or unguided reasoning had minimal or negative effects, while concise object-grounded rationales significantly improved precision and F1 scores.

Conclusion: VLMs' core limitation is not in recognizing persuasive objects but in linking them to communicative intent, suggesting they lack deeper understanding of how visual elements serve persuasive purposes.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive multi-modal reasoning and understanding. Yet, whether these models truly grasp visual persuasion-how visual cues shape human attitudes and decisions-remains unclear. To probe this question, we construct a high-consensus dataset for binary persuasiveness judgment and introduce the taxonomy of Visual Persuasive Factors (VPFs), encompassing low-level perceptual, mid-level compositional, and high-level semantic cues. We also explore cognitive steering and knowledge injection strategies for persuasion-relevant reasoning. Empirical analysis across VLMs reveals a recall-oriented bias-models over-predict high persuasiveness-and weak discriminative power for low/mid-level features. In contrast, high-level semantic alignment between message and object presence emerges as the strongest predictor of human judgment. Among intervention strategies, simple instruction or unguided reasoning scaffolds yield marginal or negative effects, whereas concise, object-grounded rationales significantly improve precision and F1 scores. These results indicate that VLMs core limitation lies not in recognizing persuasive objects but in linking them to communicative intent.

*Yunsung Kim,Mike Hardy,Joseph Tey,Candace Thille,Chris Piech*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes the AnalyticScore framework for interpretable automated scoring of short answers, introducing four principles of interpretability (FGTI) and demonstrating competitive performance with uninterpretable methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is increasing demand for transparency and interpretability in AI-driven automated scoring systems for large-scale assessments, but no widely accepted solution exists.

Method: Developed the AnalyticScore framework that: (1) extracts identifiable response elements, (2) featurizes responses into human-interpretable values using LLMs, and (3) applies ordinal logistic regression for scoring.

Result: AnalyticScore outperforms many uninterpretable scoring methods and is within 0.06 QWK of the uninterpretable state-of-the-art on average across 10 ASAP-SAS items. The featurization behavior aligns well with human annotators.

Conclusion: The proposed FGTI principles and AnalyticScore framework provide a feasible approach to interpretable automated scoring that maintains competitive accuracy while offering transparency benefits.

Abstract: AI-driven automated scoring systems offer scalable and efficient means of evaluating complex student-generated responses. Yet, despite increasing demand for transparency and interpretability, the field has yet to develop a widely accepted solution for interpretable automated scoring to be used in large-scale real-world assessments. This work takes a principled approach to address this challenge. We analyze the needs and potential benefits of interpretable automated scoring for various assessment stakeholders and develop four principles of interpretability -- Faithfulness, Groundedness, Traceability, and Interchangeability (FGTI) -- targeted at those needs. To illustrate the feasibility of implementing these principles, we develop the AnalyticScore framework for short answer scoring as a baseline reference framework for future research. AnalyticScore operates by (1) extracting explicitly identifiable elements of the responses, (2) featurizing each response into human-interpretable values using LLMs, and (3) applying an intuitive ordinal logistic regression model for scoring. In terms of scoring accuracy, AnalyticScore outperforms many uninterpretable scoring methods, and is within only 0.06 QWK of the uninterpretable SOTA on average across 10 items from the ASAP-SAS dataset. By comparing against human annotators conducting the same featurization task, we further demonstrate that the featurization behavior of AnalyticScore aligns well with that of humans.

TL;DR: MUCH is the first claim-level uncertainty quantification benchmark for LLMs, featuring 4,873 samples across 4 languages and 4 LLMs, with released generation logits and a fast deterministic segmentation algorithm for real-time monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of reliability in Large Language Models by providing a fair and reproducible benchmark for claim-level uncertainty quantification methods under realistic deployment conditions.

Method: Created a benchmark with 4,873 samples across English, French, Spanish, and German using 4 instruction-tuned open-weight LLMs. Released 24 generation logits per token and developed a deterministic segmentation algorithm that uses only 0.2% of LLM generation time.

Result: The benchmark enables evaluation of UQ methods under realistic constraints. Current methods show substantial room for improvement in both performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: MUCH provides a comprehensive benchmark for claim-level uncertainty quantification that supports both black-box and white-box methods, with efficient segmentation suitable for real-time monitoring of LLM outputs.

Abstract: Claim-level Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to mitigate the lack of reliability in Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce MUCH, the first claim-level UQ benchmark designed for fair and reproducible evaluation of future methods under realistic conditions. It includes 4,873 samples across four European languages (English, French, Spanish, and German) and four instruction-tuned open-weight LLMs. Unlike prior claim-level benchmarks, we release 24 generation logits per token, facilitating the development of future white-box methods without re-generating data. Moreover, in contrast to previous benchmarks that rely on manual or LLM-based segmentation, we propose a new deterministic algorithm capable of segmenting claims using as little as 0.2% of the LLM generation time. This makes our segmentation approach suitable for real-time monitoring of LLM outputs, ensuring that MUCH evaluates UQ methods under realistic deployment constraints. Finally, our evaluations show that current methods still have substantial room for improvement in both performance and efficiency.

Motivation: To demonstrate the maturity and competitiveness of AMD hardware, network, and software stack for large-scale pretraining, particularly for mixture-of-experts models, and provide practical guidance for systems and model design.

Method: Conducted comprehensive cluster and networking characterization with microbenchmarks for core collectives on Pollara interconnect, MI300X kernel sizing and memory bandwidth analysis, developed MI300X-aware transformer sizing rules, and trained ZAYA1 MoE model (760M active, 8.3B total parameters).

Result: ZAYA1-base achieves performance comparable to leading base models like Qwen3-4B and Gemma3-12B, and outperforms Llama-3-8B and OLMoE across reasoning, mathematics, and coding benchmarks. The AMD hardware stack proves mature for competitive large-scale pretraining.

Conclusion: AMD hardware, network, and software stack are sufficiently mature and optimized for competitive large-scale pretraining, with the study providing valuable practical guidance for both systems and model design on AMD platforms.

Abstract: We report on the first large-scale mixture-of-experts (MoE) pretraining study on pure AMD hardware, utilizing both MI300X GPUs with Pollara interconnect. We distill practical guidance for both systems and model design. On the systems side, we deliver a comprehensive cluster and networking characterization: microbenchmarks for all core collectives (all-reduce, reduce-scatter, all-gather, broadcast) across message sizes and GPU counts on Pollara. To our knowledge, this is the first at this scale. We further provide MI300X microbenchmarks on kernel sizing and memory bandwidth to inform model design. On the modeling side, we introduce and apply MI300X-aware transformer sizing rules for attention and MLP blocks and justify MoE widths that jointly optimize training throughput and inference latency. We describe our training stack in depth, including often-ignored utilities such as fault-tolerance and checkpoint-reshaping, as well as detailed information on our training recipe. We also provide a preview of our model architecture and base model - ZAYA1 (760M active, 8.3B total parameters MoE) - which will be further improved upon in forthcoming papers. ZAYA1-base achieves performance comparable to leading base models such as Qwen3-4B and Gemma3-12B at its scale and larger, and outperforms models including Llama-3-8B and OLMoE across reasoning, mathematics, and coding benchmarks. Together, these results demonstrate that the AMD hardware, network, and software stack are mature and optimized enough for competitive large-scale pretraining.

*Yeqin Zhang,Yizheng Zhao,Chen Hu,Binxing Jiao,Daxin Jiang,Ruihang Miao,Cam-Tu Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM2Comp uses context compression as a pretext task to adapt LLMs for text representation, outperforming token-level methods like masked next-token prediction and achieving better performance with less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs are suboptimal for text representation due to their causal nature and next-token prediction optimization. Existing adaptation methods rely on token-level objectives, but context compression offers untapped potential for better holistic representations.

Method: Proposes context compression as a pretext task where the model learns to generate compact memory tokens that substitute the entire context for downstream sequence prediction. Combines this with contrastive learning for improved representations.

Result: LLM2Comp significantly outperforms models trained with token-level pretext tasks. The approach is more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data while achieving superior performance across a wide range of tasks.

Conclusion: Context compression is an effective pretext task for adapting LLMs to text representation, producing strong representation models that outperform contemporary LLM-based text encoders with better efficiency.

Abstract: Text representation plays a critical role in tasks like clustering, retrieval, and other downstream applications. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale multilingual datasets specifically tailored for automatic post-editing of NMT outputs, which has hindered the development of effective APE systems despite advances in neural machine translation.

Method: Created and released LangMark - a human-annotated multilingual APE dataset containing 206,983 triplets (source segment, NMT output, human post-edited translation) for English to seven languages, annotated by expert linguists. Used this dataset to empirically test LLMs with few-shot prompting for APE tasks.

Result: Large Language Models with few-shot prompting can effectively perform automatic post-editing, improving upon leading commercial and even proprietary machine translation systems using the LangMark dataset.

Conclusion: The LangMark dataset provides a valuable resource that facilitates future development and evaluation of APE systems, demonstrating that LLMs can successfully perform automatic post-editing to enhance machine translation quality.

Abstract: Automatic post-editing (APE) aims to correct errors in machine-translated text, enhancing translation quality, while reducing the need for human intervention. Despite advances in neural machine translation (NMT), the development of effective APE systems has been hindered by the lack of large-scale multilingual datasets specifically tailored to NMT outputs. To address this gap, we present and release LangMark, a new human-annotated multilingual APE dataset for English translation to seven languages: Brazilian Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. The dataset has 206,983 triplets, with each triplet consisting of a source segment, its NMT output, and a human post-edited translation. Annotated by expert human linguists, our dataset offers both linguistic diversity and scale. Leveraging this dataset, we empirically show that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting can effectively perform APE, improving upon leading commercial and even proprietary machine translation systems. We believe that this new resource will facilitate the future development and evaluation of APE systems.

*Vy Nguyen,Ziqi Xu,Jeffrey Chan,Estrid He,Feng Xia,Xiuzhen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ABCA is a new framework for early abstention in LLMs that uses causal inference to analyze internal knowledge diversity across different aspects, enabling abstention when knowledge conflicts or is insufficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing abstention methods rely on post-generation signals, limiting their ability to prevent unreliable responses in advance. There's a need for early abstention that can analyze LLM knowledge reliability before generation.

Method: Aspect-Based Causal Abstention (ABCA) analyzes internal diversity of LLM knowledge through causal inference, considering diverse aspects like disciplines, legal contexts, or temporal frames. It estimates causal effects conditioned on these aspects to assess knowledge reliability.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks show that ABCA improves abstention reliability, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and enhances the interpretability of abstention decisions.

Conclusion: ABCA provides an effective framework for early abstention in LLMs by leveraging causal inference to analyze knowledge diversity, offering better reliability and interpretability compared to post-generation methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent but factually incorrect responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Abstention, where the model chooses not to answer and instead outputs phrases such as "I don't know", is a common safeguard. However, existing abstention methods typically rely on post-generation signals, such as generation variations or feedback, which limits their ability to prevent unreliable responses in advance. In this paper, we introduce Aspect-Based Causal Abstention (ABCA), a new framework that enables early abstention by analysing the internal diversity of LLM knowledge through causal inference. This diversity reflects the multifaceted nature of parametric knowledge acquired from various sources, representing diverse aspects such as disciplines, legal contexts, or temporal frames. ABCA estimates causal effects conditioned on these aspects to assess the reliability of knowledge relevant to a given query. Based on these estimates, we enable two types of abstention: Type-1, where aspect effects are inconsistent (knowledge conflict), and Type-2, where aspect effects consistently support abstention (knowledge insufficiency). Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ABCA improves abstention reliability, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and enhances the interpretability of abstention decisions.

### [30] [Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) Model for Integrating Statistical and Semantic Features in News Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17184)
*Mohammad Zare*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) model that combines statistical and semantic features for news text classification, using attention mechanisms to dynamically weight feature importance and achieving superior performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional statistical methods capture word-level importance but miss contextual meaning, while deep learning approaches understand semantics but may overlook simple statistical indicators. There's a need to combine both feature types for better classification.

Method: The AGFF model integrates statistical features (like TF-IDF) and semantic features in a unified framework using attention-based mechanisms to dynamically determine the relative importance of each feature type for classification decisions.

Result: Evaluation on benchmark news datasets shows the AGFF model achieves superior performance compared to both traditional statistical models and purely semantic deep learning models, with ablation studies confirming the contribution of each fusion component.

Conclusion: Strategic integration of diverse feature types significantly enhances classification accuracy, and the model effectively balances complementary strengths of statistical and semantic representations, making it practical for real-world news classification tasks.

Abstract: News text classification is a crucial task in natural language processing, essential for organizing and filtering the massive volume of digital content. Traditional methods typically rely on statistical features like term frequencies or TF-IDF values, which are effective at capturing word-level importance but often fail to reflect contextual meaning. In contrast, modern deep learning approaches utilize semantic features to understand word usage within context, yet they may overlook simple, high-impact statistical indicators. This paper introduces an Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) model that combines statistical and semantic features in a unified framework. The model applies an attention-based mechanism to dynamically determine the relative importance of each feature type, enabling more informed classification decisions. Through evaluation on benchmark news datasets, the AGFF model demonstrates superior performance compared to both traditional statistical models and purely semantic deep learning models. The results confirm that strategic integration of diverse feature types can significantly enhance classification accuracy. Additionally, ablation studies validate the contribution of each component in the fusion process. The findings highlight the model's ability to balance and exploit the complementary strengths of statistical and semantic representations, making it a practical and effective solution for real-world news classification tasks.

### [31] [AutoLink: Autonomous Schema Exploration and Expansion for Scalable Schema Linking in Text-to-SQL at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17190)
*Ziyang Wang,Yuanlei Zheng,Zhenbiao Cao,Xiaojin Zhang,Zhongyu Wei,Pei Fu,Zhenbo Luo,Wei Chen,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoLink is an autonomous agent framework that reformulates schema linking as an iterative process to identify relevant database schema components without requiring the full schema, achieving state-of-the-art performance with exceptional scalability for industrial text-to-SQL systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing schema linking methods for text-to-SQL are impractical for industrial-scale applications due to context window limits, irrelevant noise from full database schemas, high costs, poor scalability to large databases, and difficulty balancing recall and noise.

Method: AutoLink uses an autonomous agent framework guided by an LLM to dynamically explore and expand the linked schema subset through an iterative process, progressively identifying necessary schema components without inputting the full database schema.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art strict schema linking recall of 97.4% on Bird-Dev and 91.2% on Spider-2.0-Lite, with competitive execution accuracy of 68.7% EX on Bird-Dev (better than CHESS) and 34.9% EX on Spider-2.0-Lite (ranking 2nd on official leaderboard).

Conclusion: AutoLink provides a highly scalable, high-recall schema-linking solution that maintains high recall, efficient token consumption, and robust execution accuracy on large schemas (over 3,000 columns) where existing methods severely degrade, making it suitable for industrial text-to-SQL systems.

Abstract: For industrial-scale text-to-SQL, supplying the entire database schema to Large Language Models (LLMs) is impractical due to context window limits and irrelevant noise. Schema linking, which filters the schema to a relevant subset, is therefore critical. However, existing methods incur prohibitive costs, struggle to trade off recall and noise, and scale poorly to large databases. We present \textbf{AutoLink}, an autonomous agent framework that reformulates schema linking as an iterative, agent-driven process. Guided by an LLM, AutoLink dynamically explores and expands the linked schema subset, progressively identifying necessary schema components without inputting the full database schema. Our experiments demonstrate AutoLink's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art strict schema linking recall of \textbf{97.4\%} on Bird-Dev and \textbf{91.2\%} on Spider-2.0-Lite, with competitive execution accuracy, i.e., \textbf{68.7\%} EX on Bird-Dev (better than CHESS) and \textbf{34.9\%} EX on Spider-2.0-Lite (ranking 2nd on the official leaderboard). Crucially, AutoLink exhibits \textbf{exceptional scalability}, \textbf{maintaining high recall}, \textbf{efficient token consumption}, and \textbf{robust execution accuracy} on large schemas (e.g., over 3,000 columns) where existing methods severely degrade-making it a highly scalable, high-recall schema-linking solution for industrial text-to-SQL systems.

*Tao Yuan,Haoli Bai,Yinfei Pan,Xuyang Cao,Tianyu Zhang,Lu Hou,Ting Hu,Xianzhi Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: E3 is a layer pruning framework that addresses performance degradation, high training costs, and limited acceleration through differentiable mask optimization and entropy-aware knowledge distillation, achieving near-original accuracy with significant speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing layer pruning methods that struggle with performance degradation, high training costs, and limited acceleration simultaneously.

Method: Uses differentiable mask optimization with Gumbel-TopK sampler for efficient pruning mask search and entropy-aware adaptive knowledge distillation for enhanced task performance.

Result: Achieves 96% accuracy (only 0.8% drop from original 96.8%) on MATH-500 when pruning 25% layers of Qwen3-32B, outperforming SOTA (95%), with 1.33× inference speedup using only 0.5B tokens (0.5% of post-training data).

Conclusion: E3 framework demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches across diverse model architectures and benchmarks, providing an effective solution for practical model deployment.

Abstract: With the increasing size of large language models, layer pruning has gained increased attention as a hardware-friendly approach for model compression. However, existing layer pruning methods struggle to simultaneously address key practical deployment challenges, including performance degradation, high training costs, and limited acceleration. To overcome these limitations, we propose \name, a task-\underline{E}ffective, training-\underline{E}conomical and inference-\underline{E}fficient layer pruning framework. \namespace introduces two key innovations: (1) a differentiable mask optimization method using a Gumbel-TopK sampler, enabling efficient and precise pruning mask search; and (2) an entropy-aware adaptive knowledge distillation strategy that enhances task performance. Extensive experiments over diverse model architectures and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches. Notably, \namespace achieves 96\% accuracy, a mere 0.8\% drop from the original model (96.8\%) on MATH-500 when pruning 25\% layers of Qwen3-32B, outperforming existing SOTA (95\%), with a 1.33$\times$ inference speedup by consuming merely 0.5B tokens (0.5\% of the post-training data volume).

### [33] [A Simple Yet Strong Baseline for Long-Term Conversational Memory of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17208)
*Sizhe Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an event-centric memory approach for LLM-based conversational agents that represents dialogue history as structured event propositions rather than compressed summaries, enabling better long-term coherence and personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents struggle with long-term conversational coherence due to fixed context windows and trade-offs between coarse retrieval and fragmented views of dialogue history.

Method: Decompose sessions into enriched elementary discourse units (EDUs) with normalized entities and organize them in a heterogeneous graph, then use dense similarity search with LLM filtering and optional graph propagation for retrieval.

Result: The event-centric memory approach matches or surpasses strong baselines on LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks while using much shorter QA contexts.

Conclusion: Structurally simple, event-level memory provides a principled and practical foundation for long-horizon conversational agents.

Abstract: LLM-based conversational agents still struggle to maintain coherent, personalized interaction over many sessions: fixed context windows limit how much history can be kept in view, and most external memory approaches trade off between coarse retrieval over large chunks and fine-grained but fragmented views of the dialogue. Motivated by neo-Davidsonian event semantics, we propose an event-centric alternative that represents conversational history as short, event-like propositions which bundle together participants, temporal cues, and minimal local context, rather than as independent relation triples or opaque summaries. In contrast to work that aggressively compresses or forgets past content, our design aims to preserve information in a non-compressive form and make it more accessible, rather than more lossy. Concretely, we instruct an LLM to decompose each session into enriched elementary discourse units (EDUs) -- self-contained statements with normalized entities and source turn attributions -- and organize sessions, EDUs, and their arguments in a heterogeneous graph that supports associative recall. On top of this representation we build two simple retrieval-based variants that use dense similarity search and LLM filtering, with an optional graph-based propagation step to connect and aggregate evidence across related EDUs. Experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval$_S$ benchmarks show that these event-centric memories match or surpass strong baselines, while operating with much shorter QA contexts. Our results suggest that structurally simple, event-level memory provides a principled and practical foundation for long-horizon conversational agents. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/KevinSRR/EMem.

*Yusuf Çelebi,Mahmoud El Hussieni,Özay Ezerceli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARROT is a framework that measures how LLMs' accuracy degrades under social pressure and sycophancy, showing that advanced models resist authority influence while older/smaller models suffer severe epistemic collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the phenomenon of sycophancy (excessive conformity) in LLMs when faced with social pressure from authority figures, and to systematically measure how this affects model accuracy and confidence.

Method: PARROT uses: (i) double-blind evaluation comparing neutral vs authoritatively false versions of questions, (ii) log-likelihood-based calibration tracking to quantify confidence shifts, and (iii) an eight-state behavioral taxonomy to classify failure modes.

Result: Advanced models (GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) show low follow rates (≤11%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models (GPT-4: 80%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94%) exhibit severe epistemic collapse. International law and global knowledge are fragile domains, while elementary mathematics is resilient.

Conclusion: Resistance to overfitting pressure should be a primary objective alongside accuracy, harm avoidance, and privacy for safe real-world deployment of LLMs.

Abstract: This study presents PARROT (Persuasion and Agreement Robustness Rating of Output Truth), a robustness focused framework designed to measure the degradation in accuracy that occurs under social pressure exerted on users through authority and persuasion in large language models (LLMs) the phenomenon of sycophancy (excessive conformity). PARROT (i) isolates causal effects by comparing the neutral version of the same question with an authoritatively false version using a double-blind evaluation, (ii) quantifies confidence shifts toward the correct and imposed false responses using log-likelihood-based calibration tracking, and (iii) systematically classifies failure modes (e.g., robust correct, sycophantic agreement, reinforced error, stubborn error, self-correction, etc.) using an eight-state behavioral taxonomy. We evaluated 22 models using 1,302 MMLU-style multiple-choice questions across 13 domains and domain-specific authority templates. Findings show marked heterogeneity: advanced models (e.g., GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) exhibit low "follow rates" ($\leq 11\%$, GPT-5: 4\%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models show severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80\%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94\%). The danger is not limited to response changes; weak models reduce confidence in the correct response while increasing confidence in the imposed incorrect response. While international law and global knowledge at the domain level exhibit high fragility, elementary mathematics is relatively resilient. Consequently, we argue that the goal of "resistance to overfitting pressure" should be addressed as a primary objective alongside accuracy, harm avoidance, and privacy for safe deployment in the real world.

*Anshul Singh,Rohan Chaudhary,Gagneet Singh,Abhay Kumary*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MirageTVQA is a new multilingual benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on table reasoning tasks, featuring 60,000 QA pairs across 24 languages with visually imperfect tables that mimic real-world scanned documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tabular QA datasets are predominantly English-only and use digitally perfect tables, creating a gap between research and real-world applications where tables are often multilingual and visually noisy.

Method: Created MirageTVQA benchmark with nearly 60,000 QA pairs across 24 languages, incorporating realistic visual noise to simulate scanned documents, and evaluated leading VLMs on this challenging dataset.

Result: Evaluation revealed two major failure points: severe performance degradation (over 35% drop for best models) when faced with visual noise, and consistent English-first bias where reasoning abilities don't transfer to other languages.

Conclusion: MirageTVQA provides a crucial benchmark for measuring and driving progress towards more robust VLM models capable of handling real-world table reasoning scenarios with multilingual content and visual imperfections.

Abstract: The impressive performance of VLMs is largely measured on benchmarks that fail to capture the complexities of real-world scenarios. Existing datasets for tabular QA, such as WikiTableQuestions and FinQA, are overwhelmingly monolingual (English) and present tables in a digitally perfect, clean format. This creates a significant gap between research and practice. To address this, we present \textbf{MirageTVQA}, a new benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs on these exact dimensions. Featuring nearly 60,000 QA pairs across 24 languages, MirageTVQA challenges models with tables that are not only multilingual but also visually imperfect, incorporating realistic noise to mimic scanned documents. Our evaluation of the leading VLMs reveals two primary failure points: a severe degradation in performance (over 35\% drop for the best models) when faced with visual noise and a consistent English-first bias where reasoning abilities fail to transfer to other languages. MirageTVQA provides a benchmark for measuring and driving progress towards more robust VLM models for table reasoning.

### [36] [Social-Media Based Personas Challenge: Hybrid Prediction of Common and Rare User Actions on Bluesky](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17241)
*Benjamin White,Anastasia Shimorina*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid methodology for predicting both frequent and rare user behaviors on social media platforms, evaluated on a large-scale Bluesky dataset with 6.4 million conversation threads across 12 distinct user actions and 25 persona clusters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and predicting user behavior is crucial for content recommendation and platform design, but existing approaches primarily focus on common actions while rare but significant behaviors remain largely unexplored.

Method: Combines four approaches: (i) lookup database system based on historical patterns, (ii) persona-specific LightGBM models with temporal and semantic features for common actions, (iii) hybrid neural architecture fusing textual and temporal representations for rare actions, and (iv) text reply generation.

Result: Persona-specific models achieved average macro F1-score of 0.64 for common action prediction, while rare action classifier achieved 0.56 macro F1-score across 10 rare actions. The approach won first place in the SocialSim challenge at COLM 2025.

Conclusion: Effective social media behavior prediction requires tailored modeling strategies that recognize fundamental differences between action types, with specialized approaches needed for both common and rare behaviors.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting user behavior on social media platforms is crucial for content recommendation and platform design. While existing approaches focus primarily on common actions like retweeting and liking, the prediction of rare but significant behaviors remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a hybrid methodology for social media user behavior prediction that addresses both frequent and infrequent actions across a diverse action vocabulary. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale Bluesky dataset containing 6.4 million conversation threads spanning 12 distinct user actions across 25 persona clusters. Our methodology combines four complementary approaches: (i) a lookup database system based on historical response patterns; (ii) persona-specific LightGBM models with engineered temporal and semantic features for common actions; (iii) a specialized hybrid neural architecture fusing textual and temporal representations for rare action classification; and (iv) generation of text replies. Our persona-specific models achieve an average macro F1-score of 0.64 for common action prediction, while our rare action classifier achieves 0.56 macro F1-score across 10 rare actions. These results demonstrate that effective social media behavior prediction requires tailored modeling strategies recognizing fundamental differences between action types. Our approach achieved first place in the SocialSim: Social-Media Based Personas challenge organized at the Social Simulation with LLMs workshop at COLM 2025.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a culturally adapted Estonian translation of the WinoGrande commonsense reasoning benchmark, evaluating both human and machine translation approaches and their impact on model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a reliable Estonian benchmark for evaluating commonsense reasoning in LLMs, addressing the limitations of machine translation and emphasizing the need for cultural adaptation and linguistic expertise.

Method: Human translation by specialists, evaluation of proprietary and open-source models on both human and machine-translated datasets, and prompt engineering experiments to improve machine translation quality.

Result: Model performance was slightly lower on human-translated Estonian data compared to original English, and significantly worse on machine-translated data. Prompt engineering provided limited improvements in translation quality or model accuracy.

Conclusion: Human translation by language specialists is crucial for reliable dataset adaptation and evaluation of language competency in LLMs, as machine translation and prompt engineering alone are insufficient for high-quality cultural and linguistic adaptation.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a localized and culturally adapted Estonian translation of the test set from the widely used commonsense reasoning benchmark, WinoGrande. We detail the translation and adaptation process carried out by translation specialists and evaluate the performance of both proprietary and open source models on the human translated benchmark. Additionally, we explore the feasibility of achieving high-quality machine translation by incorporating insights from the manual translation process into the design of a detailed prompt. This prompt is specifically tailored to address both the linguistic characteristics of Estonian and the unique translation challenges posed by the WinoGrande dataset. Our findings show that model performance on the human translated Estonian dataset is slightly lower than on the original English test set, while performance on machine-translated data is notably worse. Additionally, our experiments indicate that prompt engineering offers limited improvement in translation quality or model accuracy, and highlight the importance of involving language specialists in dataset translation and adaptation to ensure reliable and interpretable evaluations of language competency and reasoning in large language models.

*Koena Ronny Mabokela,Tim Schlippe,Matthias Wölfel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes zero-shot sentiment analysis performance of state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LlaMa 2, PaLM 2, Dolly 2) on South African social media posts in English, Sepedi and Setswana, showing that LLM fusion achieves below 1% error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage LLMs for sentiment analysis on social media posts in South African languages to detect social challenges, as no previous work has investigated this application for multilingual sentiment analysis in South Africa.

Method: Analyzed zero-shot performance of five state-of-the-art LLMs on sentiment analysis of social media posts covering 10 emerging topics within 10 South African government departments' jurisdictions, across English, Sepedi and Setswana languages.

Result: Big differences observed between various LLMs, topics, and languages. Fusion of multiple LLM outcomes provides large performance gains with sentiment classification errors below 1%.

Conclusion: It is now feasible to provide reliable sentiment analysis systems to detect social challenges and identify needs for action on specific topics across different language groups in South Africa.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis can aid in understanding people's opinions and emotions on social issues. In multilingual communities sentiment analysis systems can be used to quickly identify social challenges in social media posts, enabling government departments to detect and address these issues more precisely and effectively. Recently, large-language models (LLMs) have become available to the wide public and initial analyses have shown that they exhibit magnificent zero-shot sentiment analysis abilities in English. However, there is no work that has investigated to leverage LLMs for sentiment analysis on social media posts in South African languages and detect social challenges. Consequently, in this work, we analyse the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LlaMa 2, PaLM 2, and Dolly 2 to investigate the sentiment polarities of the 10 most emerging topics in English, Sepedi and Setswana social media posts that fall within the jurisdictional areas of 10 South African government departments. Our results demonstrate that there are big differences between the various LLMs, topics, and languages. In addition, we show that a fusion of the outcomes of different LLMs provides large gains in sentiment classification performance with sentiment classification errors below 1%. Consequently, it is now feasible to provide systems that generate reliable information about sentiment analysis to detect social challenges and draw conclusions about possible needs for actions on specific topics and within different language groups.

*Mateusz Jacniacki,Martí Carmona Serrat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HUMA is an LLM-based conversational agent designed for multi-party group chats that uses human-like timing and interaction strategies, making it difficult for participants to distinguish from human facilitators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most current conversational agents are designed for one-on-one turn-based exchanges, but as AI assistants become more widespread, developing natural human-like interaction patterns for group conversations is crucial for maintaining user trust and engagement.

Method: HUMA uses an event-driven architecture with three components: Router, Action Agent, and Reflection. It handles messages, replies, reactions and simulates realistic response times to adapt LLMs to group conversation dynamics.

Result: In a study with 97 participants in four-person role-play chats, participants classified community managers as human at near-chance rates in both AI and human conditions, indicating they couldn't reliably distinguish HUMA agents from humans. Subjective experiences showed only modest differences with small effect sizes.

Conclusion: In natural group chat settings, an AI facilitator like HUMA can match human quality while remaining difficult to identify as nonhuman, suggesting the feasibility of human-like AI participation in multi-party conversations.

Abstract: Conversational agents built on large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly prevalent, yet most systems are designed for one-on-one, turn-based exchanges rather than natural, asynchronous group chats. As AI assistants become widespread throughout digital platforms, from virtual assistants to customer service, developing natural and humanlike interaction patterns seems crucial for maintaining user trust and engagement. We present the Humanlike Multi-user Agent (HUMA), an LLM-based facilitator that participates in multi-party conversations using human-like strategies and timing. HUMA extends prior multi-user chatbot work with an event-driven architecture that handles messages, replies, reactions and introduces realistic response-time simulation. HUMA comprises three components-Router, Action Agent, and Reflection-which together adapt LLMs to group conversation dynamics.
  We evaluate HUMA in a controlled study with 97 participants in four-person role-play chats, comparing AI and human community managers (CMs). Participants classified CMs as human at near-chance rates in both conditions, indicating they could not reliably distinguish HUMA agents from humans. Subjective experience was comparable across conditions: community-manager effectiveness, social presence, and engagement/satisfaction differed only modestly with small effect sizes. Our results suggest that, in natural group chat settings, an AI facilitator can match human quality while remaining difficult to identify as nonhuman.

TL;DR: ReVeL framework converts multiple-choice questions to open-form questions to address answer guessing and improve evaluation reliability in multimodal language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) formats can leak exploitable signals, making accuracy metrics unreliable and encouraging answer guessing behaviors during reinforcement fine-tuning.

Method: Proposed ReVeL framework that rewrites MCQA into open-form questions, categorizes questions by answer types, applies different rewriting/verification schemes, and uses GRPO to finetune Qwen2.5-VL models on 20k converted examples.

Result: Models trained on ReVeL-OpenQA match MCQA accuracy on multiple-choice benchmarks and improve OpenQA accuracy by ~6 percentage points. ReVeL reveals up to 20 percentage points of score inflation in MCQA benchmarks and improves judging accuracy while reducing cost and latency.

Conclusion: ReVeL provides better data efficiency and more robust reward signals than MCQA-based training, improves evaluation reliability, and will be released publicly.

Abstract: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) has been a popular format for evaluating and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) of modern multimodal language models. Its constrained output format allows for simplified, deterministic automatic verification. However, we find that the options may leak exploitable signals, which makes the accuracy metrics unreliable for indicating real capabilities and encourages explicit or implicit answer guessing behaviors during RFT. We propose ReVeL (Rewrite and Verify by LLM), a framework that rewrites multiple-choice questions into open-form questions while keeping answers verifiable whenever possible. The framework categorizes questions according to different answer types, apply different rewriting and verification schemes, respectively. When applied for RFT, we converted 20k MCQA examples and use GRPO to finetune Qwen2.5-VL models. Models trained on ReVeL-OpenQA match MCQA accuracy on multiple-choice benchmarks and improve OpenQA accuracy by about six percentage points, indicating better data efficiency and more robust reward signals than MCQA-based training. When used for evaluation, ReVeL also reveals up to 20 percentage points of score inflation in MCQA benchmarks (relative to OpenQA), improves judging accuracy, and reduces both cost and latency. We will release code and data publicly.

*Xiaoyun Jin,Mirjam Ernestus,R. Harald Baayen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates how word meanings influence pitch contours in spontaneous Mandarin conversation, finding that semantics significantly predict tonal realization even when controlling for other factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how semantic factors affect the realization of pitch contours in Mandarin monosyllabic words during spontaneous conversation, challenging standard tonal theories.

Method: Used generalized additive models to decompose pitch contours into components tied to control variables and semantic predictors, analyzing word sense effects, heterographic homophones, and contextualized embeddings.

Result: Word meaning strongly predicts tonal realization; word sense is a better predictor than word identity, heterographic homophones have different pitch contours, and contextualized embeddings can predict pitch contours with accuracy exceeding permutation baselines.

Conclusion: Semantics significantly influence Mandarin tonal realization, supporting the Discriminative Lexicon Model framework and challenging standard tonal theories, with distributional semantics emerging as a valuable phonetic predictor.

Abstract: We present a corpus-based investigation of how the pitch contours of monosyllabic words are realized in spontaneous conversational Mandarin, focusing on the effects of words' meanings. We used the generalized additive model to decompose a given observed pitch contour into a set of component pitch contours that are tied to different control variables and semantic predictors. Even when variables such as word duration, gender, speaker identity, tonal context, vowel height, and utterance position are controlled for, the effect of word remains a strong predictor of tonal realization. We present evidence that this effect of word is a semantic effect: word sense is shown to be a better predictor than word, and heterographic homophones are shown to have different pitch contours. The strongest evidence for the importance of semantics is that the pitch contours of individual word tokens can be predicted from their contextualized embeddings with an accuracy that substantially exceeds a permutation baseline. For phonetics, distributional semantics is a new kid on the block. Although our findings challenge standard theories of Mandarin tone, they fit well within the theoretical framework of the Discriminative Lexicon Model.

Result: Achieves high accuracy in NLI tasks and demonstrates robustness against textual biases, validated through a controlled adversarial dataset.

Conclusion: Using visual modality as meaning representation shows promise for robust natural language understanding.

Abstract: We propose a zero-shot method for Natural Language Inference (NLI) that leverages multimodal representations by grounding language in visual contexts. Our approach generates visual representations of premises using text-to-image models and performs inference by comparing these representations with textual hypotheses. We evaluate two inference techniques: cosine similarity and visual question answering. Our method achieves high accuracy without task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating robustness against textual biases and surface heuristics. Additionally, we design a controlled adversarial dataset to validate the robustness of our approach. Our findings suggest that leveraging visual modality as a meaning representation provides a promising direction for robust natural language understanding.

*Zhen Wang,Zhifeng Gao,Guolin Ke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MR-RLVR enhances RLVR for mathematical reasoning by adding process-level self-supervised rewards through masked-then-fill and step reordering, achieving significant performance gains on mathematical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address RLVR's limited scalability in mathematical reasoning where intermediate steps are crucial but final answers are hard to verify, and to prevent token-level SFT from degenerating into memorization.

Method: Two-stage training: first self-supervised training with masked-then-fill and step reordering on mathematical data, then RLVR fine-tuning on outcome-verifiable datasets.

Result: Average relative gains over original RLVR: +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8 on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Process-aware self-supervised signals effectively enhance RLVR's scalability and performance in outcome-verifiable mathematical reasoning settings.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has been shown to substantially improve large language models' (LLMs) mathematical reasoning. However, for a large portion of mathematical corpora, especially theorem proving, RLVR's scalability is limited: intermediate reasoning is crucial, while final answers are difficult to directly and reliably verify. Meanwhile, token-level SFT often degenerates into rote memorization rather than inducing longer chains of thought. Inspired by BERT's self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via "masked-then-fill" and "step reordering" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning. Our training pipeline comprises two stages: we first perform self-supervised training on sampled mathematical calculation and proof data; we then conduct RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable. We implement MR-RLVR on Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and evaluate on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500. Under a fixed sampling and decoding budget, MR-RLVR achieves average relative gains over the original RLVR of +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8. These results indicate that incorporating process-aware self-supervised signals can effectively enhance RLVR's scalability and performance in only outcome-verifiable settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Selective RoPE introduces input-dependent rotary position embeddings that enable arbitrary rotation angles in transformers, improving performance on language modeling and sequence tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between fixed-angle RoPE in softmax transformers and input-dependent gating in linear transformers, leveraging selectivity to enhance positional encoding.

Method: Developed Selective RoPE as an input-dependent rotary embedding mechanism that generalizes RoPE, enabling arbitrary rotation angles and revealing implicit positional structures in attention mechanisms.

Result: Demonstrated improved performance in language modeling and challenging sequence tasks like copying, state tracking, and retrieval when equipping gated transformers with Selective RoPE.

Conclusion: Input-dependent rotations through Selective RoPE provide superior positional encoding compared to fixed-angle approaches, uncovering hidden positional structures in transformer architectures.

Abstract: Position information is essential for language modeling. In softmax transformers, Rotary Position Embeddings (\textit{RoPE}) encode positions through \textit{fixed-angle} rotations, while in linear transformers, order is handled via input-dependent (selective) gating that decays past key-value associations. Selectivity has generally been shown to improve language-related tasks. Inspired by this, we introduce \textit{Selective RoPE}, an \textit{input-dependent} rotary embedding mechanism, that generalizes \textit{RoPE}, and enables rotation in \textit{arbitrary angles} for both linear and softmax transformers. We show that softmax attention already performs a hidden form of these rotations on query-key pairs, uncovering an implicit positional structure. We further show that in state-space models and gated linear transformers, the real part manages forgetting while the imaginary part encodes positions through rotations. We validate our method by equipping gated transformers with \textit{Selective RoPE}, demonstrating that its input-dependent rotations improve performance in language modeling and on difficult sequence tasks like copying, state tracking, and retrieval.

TL;DR: The study found a creativity gradient in image generation: Visual Artists > Non Artists > Human Inspired AI > Self Guided AI. Human guidance significantly improved AI creativity, and human/AI raters showed different judgment patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs match human creativity in language tasks, visual creativity remains underexplored. This study aims to compare human and AI visual creativity and understand how human input affects AI creative performance.

Method: Compared image generation between human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and AI using two prompting conditions (Human Inspired with high human input, Self Guided with low human input). Used human raters (N=255) and GPT4o to evaluate creativity.

Result: Clear creativity gradient observed: Visual Artists most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired AI, and finally Self Guided AI. Human guidance strongly improved AI creative output, bringing it close to Non Artists' level. Human and AI raters showed different creativity judgment patterns.

Conclusion: GenAI faces unique challenges in visual domains compared to language tasks. Visual creativity depends on perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity - distinctly human capacities that may not be readily transferable from language models.

Abstract: While recent research suggests Large Language Models match human creative performance in divergent thinking tasks, visual creativity remains underexplored. This study compared image generation in human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and using an image generation AI model (two prompting conditions with varying human input: high for Human Inspired, low for Self Guided). Human raters (N=255) and GPT4o evaluated the creativity of the resulting images. We found a clear creativity gradient, with Visual Artists being the most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired generative AI, and finally Self Guided generative AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists. Notably, human and AI raters also showed vastly different creativity judgment patterns. These results suggest that, in contrast to language centered tasks, GenAI models may face unique challenges in visual domains, where creativity depends on perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity, distinctly human capacities that may not be readily transferable from language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an interpretable cognitive control layer for LLMs by repurposing the simplicity of retro BASIC programming, making reasoning processes more transparent and structured.

Method: Developed a BASIC-style prompting language with numbered lines and simple commands, along with a natural-language interpreter file that specifies command semantics, memory updates, and logging behavior. The system extracts declarative and procedural knowledge, detects contradictions, and produces resolutions.

Result: Comparison across three LLMs on knowledge extraction, conflict detection, and reasoning tasks showed that all models can execute Cognitive BASIC programs, with overall strong but not uniform performance.

Conclusion: Cognitive BASIC successfully enables LLMs to perform structured, stepwise reasoning with explicit execution traces, demonstrating the viability of using simple programming language constructs as a cognitive control layer for transparent reasoning processes.

Abstract: Cognitive BASIC is a minimal, BASIC-style prompting language and in-model interpreter that structures large language model (LLM) reasoning into explicit, stepwise execution traces. Inspired by the simplicity of retro BASIC, we repurpose numbered lines and simple commands as an interpretable cognitive control layer. Modern LLMs can reliably simulate such short programs, enabling transparent multi-step reasoning inside the model. A natural-language interpreter file specifies command semantics, memory updates, and logging behavior. Our mental-model interpreter extracts declarative and procedural knowledge, detects contradictions, and produces resolutions when necessary. A comparison across three LLMs on a benchmark of knowledge extraction, conflict detection, and reasoning tasks shows that all models can execute Cognitive BASIC programs, with overall strong but not uniform performance.

TL;DR: A framework for systematic benchmark revision that uses statistical analysis of response patterns to identify potentially invalid questions, with up to 84% precision in flagging problematic items across nine benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually identifying errors in thousands of benchmark questions is infeasible and creates a bottleneck for reliable AI evaluation, as invalid questions undermine benchmark reliability.

Method: Leverages statistical analysis of response patterns based on the assumption that mean score summarizes model performance, flagging items when empirical statistics fall outside expected ranges; also uses LLM-judge first pass to reduce human effort.

Result: The method achieved up to 84% precision in identifying problematic questions across nine widely used benchmarks, effectively guiding expert review.

Conclusion: The framework provides an efficient and scalable approach for systematic benchmark revision by combining statistical analysis with automated first-pass review, significantly reducing human effort while maintaining high precision.

Abstract: Benchmarks are pivotal in driving AI progress, and invalid benchmark questions frequently undermine their reliability. Manually identifying and correcting errors among thousands of benchmark questions is not only infeasible but also a critical bottleneck for reliable evaluation. In this work, we introduce a framework for systematic benchmark revision that leverages statistical analysis of response patterns to flag potentially invalid questions for further expert review. Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance. This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item. When empirically estimated values for these statistics fall outside the expected range for an item, the item is more likely to be problematic. Across nine widely used benchmarks, our method guides expert review to identify problematic questions with up to 84\% precision. In addition, we introduce an LLM-judge first pass to review questions, further reducing human effort. Together, these components provide an efficient and scalable framework for systematic benchmark revision.

*Ye Han,Lijun Zhang,Dejian Meng,Zhuang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism to solve vanishing reward differences in multi-vehicle cooperative driving, combining Temporal Difference Reward and Action Gradient Reward to improve policy gradient SNR and learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional state-based reward functions in multi-vehicle cooperative driving suffer from vanishing reward differences due to temporal quasi-steady traffic states and physical proximity of actions, leading to low signal-to-noise ratio in policy gradients that hinders algorithm convergence.

Method: HDR integrates two components: Temporal Difference Reward based on global potential function for optimal policy invariance and long-term objectives, and Action Gradient Reward that directly measures marginal utility of actions for local guidance with high SNR. Implemented in Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game framework with time-varying agent set.

Result: Extensive experiments with online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning algorithms (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) show HDR significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability, enabling agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies balancing traffic efficiency and safety.

Conclusion: HDR mechanism effectively addresses the vanishing reward problem in multi-vehicle cooperative driving, providing high-SNR guidance signals that enhance learning efficiency and enable effective cooperative policy learning.

Abstract: In multi-vehicle cooperative driving tasks involving high-frequency continuous control, traditional state-based reward functions suffer from the issue of vanishing reward differences. This phenomenon results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradients, significantly hindering algorithm convergence and performance improvement. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism. We first theoretically elucidate how the temporal quasi-steady nature of traffic states and the physical proximity of actions lead to the failure of traditional reward signals. Building on this analysis, the HDR framework innovatively integrates two complementary components: (1) a Temporal Difference Reward (TRD) based on a global potential function, which utilizes the evolutionary trend of potential energy to ensure optimal policy invariance and consistency with long-term objectives; and (2) an Action Gradient Reward (ARG), which directly measures the marginal utility of actions to provide a local guidance signal with a high SNR. Furthermore, we formulate the cooperative driving problem as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG) with a time-varying agent set and provide a complete instantiation scheme for HDR within this framework. Extensive experiments conducted using both online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) algorithms demonstrate that the HDR mechanism significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability. The results confirm that HDR guides agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies that effectively balance traffic efficiency and safety.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents UI extensions (verbal, visual, and combined) for Bayesian Networks to improve user understanding of probabilistic reasoning, showing that all extensions outperform baseline and combined modality works best for some question types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian Networks are considered transparent models but users still struggle to understand them, and current UIs fail to clarify BN reasoning, creating a need for better interfaces.

Method: Designed verbal and visual extensions to standard BN UI to guide users through inference patterns, then conducted a user study comparing verbal, visual, combined extensions against baseline UI.

Result: (1) All three extension types performed better than baseline for questions about observation impact, enabling paths, and observation influence; (2) Combined verbal and visual modalities outperformed single modalities for some question types.

Conclusion: UI extensions that guide users through inference patterns significantly improve understanding of Bayesian Networks, with combined verbal and visual modalities providing the most benefit for certain types of reasoning questions.

Abstract: Bayesian Networks (BNs) are an important tool for assisting probabilistic reasoning, but despite being considered transparent models, people have trouble understanding them. Further, current User Interfaces (UIs) still do not clarify the reasoning of BNs. To address this problem, we have designed verbal and visual extensions to the standard BN UI, which can guide users through common inference patterns.
  We conducted a user study to compare our verbal, visual and combined UI extensions, and a baseline UI. Our main findings are: (1) users did better with all three types of extensions than with the baseline UI for questions about the impact of an observation, the paths that enable this impact, and the way in which an observation influences the impact of other observations; and (2) using verbal and visual modalities together is better than using either modality alone for some of these question types.

TL;DR: MirrorMind is a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates individual researcher cognitive models with collective disciplinary knowledge graphs to enable more authentic AI scientific discovery by representing both personal research trajectories and social knowledge networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI scientific approaches treat discovery as solitary optimization, ignoring that human scientific insight comes from both individual cognitive trajectories shaped by personal research history and collective disciplinary memory represented through citation networks and concepts.

Method: Three-level hierarchical architecture: Individual Level (episodic, semantic, persona memories of researchers), Domain Level (structured disciplinary concept graphs), and Interdisciplinary Level (orchestration engine), with separation between memory storage and agentic execution.

Result: Evaluation across four tasks shows MirrorMind enables author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and multi-agent scientific problem solving, moving beyond simple fact retrieval to structural, personalized scientific reasoning.

Conclusion: By integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind advances AI scientific reasoning toward more authentic, insight-generating capabilities that reflect the social and historical nature of knowledge production.

Abstract: The emergence of AI Scientists has demonstrated remarkable potential in automating scientific research. However, current approaches largely conceptualize scientific discovery as a solitary optimization or search process, overlooking that knowledge production is inherently a social and historical endeavor. Human scientific insight stems from two distinct yet interconnected sources. First is the individual cognitive trajectory, where a researcher's unique insight is shaped by their evolving research history and stylistic preferences; another is the collective disciplinary memory, where knowledge is sedimented into vast, interconnected networks of citations and concepts. Existing LLMs still struggle to represent these structured, high-fidelity cognitive and social contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MirrorMind, a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates dual-memory representations within a three-level framework. The Individual Level constructs high-fidelity cognitive models of individual researchers by capturing their episodic, semantic, and persona memories; the Domain Level maps collective knowledge into structured disciplinary concept graphs; and the Interdisciplinary Level that acts as an orthogonal orchestration engine. Crucially, our architecture separates memory storage from agentic execution, enabling AI scientist agents to flexibly access individual memories for unique perspectives or collective structures to reason. We evaluate MirrorMind across four comprehensive tasks, including author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration promotion, and multi-agent scientific problem solving. The results show that by integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind moves beyond simple fact retrieval toward structural, personalized, and insight-generating scientific reasoning.

TL;DR: Budget-aware test-time scaling methods for tool-augmented agents that dynamically adapt planning strategies based on remaining tool-call budgets, improving cost-performance scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simply increasing tool-call budgets doesn't improve agent performance due to lack of budget awareness, creating a need for methods that effectively scale agents under explicit budget constraints.

Method: Introduced Budget Tracker plugin for continuous budget awareness and developed BATS framework that dynamically adapts planning and verification strategies based on remaining resources.

Result: Budget-aware methods produce more favorable scaling curves and push the cost-performance Pareto frontier compared to naive scaling approaches.

Conclusion: Budget-aware scaling enables more transparent and principled understanding of scaling in tool-augmented agents, with empirical insights for effective cost-performance optimization.

Abstract: Scaling test-time computation improves performance across different tasks on large language models (LLMs), which has also been extended to tool-augmented agents. For these agents, scaling involves not only "thinking" in tokens but also "acting" via tool calls. The number of tool calls directly bounds the agent's interaction with the external environment. However, we find that simply granting agents a larger tool-call budget fails to improve performance, as they lack "budget awareness" and quickly hit a performance ceiling. To address this, we study how to scale such agents effectively under explicit tool-call budgets, focusing on web search agents. We first introduce the Budget Tracker, a lightweight plug-in that provides the agent with continuous budget awareness, enabling simple yet effective scaling. We further develop BATS (Budget Aware Test-time Scaling), an advanced framework that leverages this awareness to dynamically adapt its planning and verification strategy, deciding whether to "dig deeper" on a promising lead or "pivot" to new paths based on remaining resources. To analyze cost-performance scaling in a controlled manner, we formalize a unified cost metric that jointly accounts for token and tool consumption. We provide the first systematic study on budget-constrained agents, showing that budget-aware methods produce more favorable scaling curves and push the cost-performance Pareto frontier. Our work offers empirical insights toward a more transparent and principled understanding of scaling in tool-augmented agents.

TL;DR: DAPS++ reinterprets diffusion models for inverse problems as an EM-style framework, decoupling diffusion initialization from data-driven refinement to improve efficiency and reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Bayesian interpretation of score-based diffusion for inverse problems fails to explain practical behavior where reconstruction is largely driven by measurement consistency rather than the prior, leading to decoupled inference from diffusion dynamics.

Method: Proposes DAPS++ framework that treats diffusion as initialization in EM-style framework, allowing likelihood term to guide inference more directly while maintaining numerical stability through decoupled diffusion and data-driven refinement stages.

Result: DAPS++ achieves high computational efficiency with fewer function evaluations and measurement-optimization steps, while providing robust reconstruction performance across diverse image restoration tasks.

Conclusion: The EM-style reinterpretation clarifies why unified diffusion trajectories remain effective in practice, and DAPS++ demonstrates improved efficiency and performance by directly leveraging likelihood guidance in inverse problem solving.

Abstract: From a Bayesian perspective, score-based diffusion solves inverse problems through joint inference, embedding the likelihood with the prior to guide the sampling process. However, this formulation fails to explain its practical behavior: the prior offers limited guidance, while reconstruction is largely driven by the measurement-consistency term, leading to an inference process that is effectively decoupled from the diffusion dynamics. To clarify this structure, we reinterpret the role of diffusion in inverse problem solving as an initialization stage within an expectation--maximization (EM)--style framework, where the diffusion stage and the data-driven refinement are fully decoupled. We introduce \textbf{DAPS++}, which allows the likelihood term to guide inference more directly while maintaining numerical stability and providing insight into why unified diffusion trajectories remain effective in practice. By requiring fewer function evaluations (NFEs) and measurement-optimization steps, \textbf{DAPS++} achieves high computational efficiency and robust reconstruction performance across diverse image restoration tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-modal method combining structured EHR data (via Bayesian networks) and unstructured clinical notes (via neural classifiers) for patient-level information extraction, using virtual evidence with consistency nodes to improve prediction calibration and handle contradictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHRs contain valuable but fragmented information - structured data (diagnoses, medications) and unstructured text (notes, summaries). Need transparent, feature-based models for high-risk clinical applications that can leverage both data types effectively.

Method: Multi-modal fusion using: 1) Bayesian networks for structured EHR features, 2) Neural text classifiers for clinical notes, 3) Virtual evidence augmented with consistency nodes for interpretable probabilistic fusion that improves calibration and handles missing/contradictory information.

Result: Method tested on SimSUM dataset (simulated EHR-text benchmark). Consistency nodes improved calibration compared to virtual evidence alone, allowing better adjustment of neural classifier outputs and resolution of contradictions between tabular and text data.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-modal fusion approach with consistency nodes provides an interpretable, probabilistic framework that effectively combines structured and unstructured EHR data, improving prediction reliability for clinical decision support systems.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) form an invaluable resource for training clinical decision support systems. To leverage the potential of such systems in high-risk applications, we need large, structured tabular datasets on which we can build transparent feature-based models. While part of the EHR already contains structured information (e.g. diagnosis codes, medications, and lab results), much of the information is contained within unstructured text (e.g. discharge summaries and nursing notes). In this work, we propose a method for multi-modal patient-level information extraction that leverages both the tabular features available in the patient's EHR (using an expert-informed Bayesian network) as well as clinical notes describing the patient's symptoms (using neural text classifiers). We propose the use of virtual evidence augmented with a consistency node to provide an interpretable, probabilistic fusion of the models' predictions. The consistency node improves the calibration of the final predictions compared to virtual evidence alone, allowing the Bayesian network to better adjust the neural classifier's output to handle missing information and resolve contradictions between the tabular and text data. We show the potential of our method on the SimSUM dataset, a simulated benchmark linking tabular EHRs with clinical notes through expert knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited integration of the BDI model into structured, semantically interoperable knowledge representations despite its importance in AI and cognitive sciences.

Method: Created a formal BDI Ontology as a modular Ontology Design Pattern that captures beliefs, desires, intentions and their interrelations, aligned with foundational ontologies. Tested through two experiments: coupling with LLMs via Logic Augmented Generation, and integration with Semas reasoning platform using T2B2T paradigm.

Result: The ontology successfully bridges declarative and procedural intelligence, enabling bidirectional flow between RDF triples and agent mental states while improving inferential coherence and consistency through ontological grounding.

Conclusion: The BDI Ontology provides both conceptual and operational foundations for cognitively grounded, explainable, and semantically interoperable multi-agent and neuro-symbolic systems in the Web of Data.

Abstract: The Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model is a cornerstone for representing rational agency in artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences. Yet, its integration into structured, semantically interoperable knowledge representations remains limited. This paper presents a formal BDI Ontology, conceived as a modular Ontology Design Pattern (ODP) that captures the cognitive architecture of agents through beliefs, desires, intentions, and their dynamic interrelations. The ontology ensures semantic precision and reusability by aligning with foundational ontologies and best practices in modular design. Two complementary lines of experimentation demonstrate its applicability: (i) coupling the ontology with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Logic Augmented Generation (LAG) to assess the contribution of ontological grounding to inferential coherence and consistency; and (ii) integrating the ontology within the Semas reasoning platform, which implements the Triples-to-Beliefs-to-Triples (T2B2T) paradigm, enabling a bidirectional flow between RDF triples and agent mental states. Together, these experiments illustrate how the BDI Ontology acts as both a conceptual and operational bridge between declarative and procedural intelligence, paving the way for cognitively grounded, explainable, and semantically interoperable multi-agent and neuro-symbolic systems operating within the Web of Data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a method to address episodic reward challenges in multi-agent reinforcement learning by incentivizing agents to explore actions that affect teammates, improving team exploration and performance in sparse reward environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Episodic rewards pose significant challenges in MARL due to exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories and existing methods' failure to account for joint actions that influence team states.

Method: Introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR) - a simple enhancement strategy that incentivizes individual agents to explore actions affecting teammates, combined with original strategies to stimulate team exploration. Also creates MiniGrid-MA environment for validation.

Result: Experimental evaluation in MiniGrid-MA environment shows superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating effective team exploration and improved algorithm performance.

Conclusion: MIR effectively addresses episodic reward challenges in MARL by promoting team exploration through mutual intrinsic rewards, achieving better performance in sparse reward scenarios.

Abstract: Episodic rewards present a significant challenge in reinforcement learning. While intrinsic reward methods have demonstrated effectiveness in single-agent rein-forcement learning scenarios, their application to multi-agent reinforcement learn-ing (MARL) remains problematic. The primary difficulties stem from two fac-tors: (1) the exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories that lead to rewards as the exploration space expands, and (2) existing methods often fail to account for joint actions that can influence team states. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards like episodic rewards. MIR incentivizes individual agents to explore actions that affect their teammates, and when combined with original strategies, effectively stimulates team exploration and improves algorithm performance. For comprehensive experimental valida-tion, we extend the representative single-agent MiniGrid environment to create MiniGrid-MA, a series of MARL environments with sparse rewards. Our evalu-ation compares the proposed method against state-of-the-art approaches in the MiniGrid-MA setting, with experimental results demonstrating superior perfor-mance.

Method: Proposed Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM) that organizes multi-agent systems into logical hierarchies mirroring domain task-dependency graphs, enforcing procedural correctness through sequential layers where each layer's agents operate on preceding outputs.

Result: EarthAgent (HTAM instantiation) substantially outperforms established single- and multi-agent systems on GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step geospatial planning tasks with metrics for tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness.

Conclusion: Aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is critical for building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems, as demonstrated by the success of the task-centric HTAM framework.

Abstract: LLM-driven agents, particularly those using general frameworks like ReAct or human-inspired role-playing, often struggle in specialized domains that necessitate rigorously structured workflows. Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems. Our work demonstrates that aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is a critical step toward building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems.

Abstract: Agentic AI seeks to endow systems with sustained autonomy, reasoning, and interaction capabilities. To realize this vision, its assumptions about agency must be complemented by explicit models of cognition, cooperation, and governance. This paper argues that the conceptual tools developed within the Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS) community, such as BDI architectures, communication protocols, mechanism design, and institutional modelling, provide precisely such a foundation. By aligning adaptive, data-driven approaches with structured models of reasoning and coordination, we outline a path toward agentic systems that are not only capable and flexible, but also transparent, cooperative, and accountable. The result is a perspective on agency that bridges formal theory and practical autonomy.

### [59] [That's not natural: The Impact of Off-Policy Training Data on Probe Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17408)
*Nathalie Kirch,Samuel Dower,Adrians Skapars,Ekdeep Singh Lubana,Dmitrii Krasheninnikov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how synthetic and off-policy training data affects probe generalization for monitoring LLM behaviors like deception and sycophancy, finding that response generation strategy impacts performance and same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than different-domain on-policy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalization across eight distinct LLM behaviors, since natural examples of concerning behaviors are rare and researchers often rely on synthetic or off-policy responses for training probes.

Method: Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs with different response generation strategies, comparing performance across behaviors and analyzing generalization from off-policy to on-policy data and across different domains.

Result: Response generation strategy significantly affects probe performance, successful off-policy generalization predicts on-policy generalization, deception and sandbagging probes may fail to generalize, and domain shifts cause larger performance degradation than policy shifts.

Conclusion: In the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.

Abstract: Probing has emerged as a promising method for monitoring Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling inference-time detection of concerning behaviours such as deception and sycophancy. However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. Notably, shifts in the training data domain still cause even larger performance degradation, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. These results indicate that, in the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SRA-CP is a decentralized cooperative perception framework that enables connected vehicles to selectively share perception data only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected, reducing communication bandwidth by 80% while maintaining safety-critical object detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CP approaches transmit large volumes of irrelevant perception data exceeding bandwidth limits and rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments.

Method: Uses a decentralized protocol where vehicles broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. Includes perceptual risk identification and selective information exchange with fusion module prioritizing safety-critical content.

Result: Achieves less than 1% AP loss for safety-critical objects compared to generic CP while using only 20% of communication bandwidth. Improves perception performance by 15% over existing selective CP methods without risk awareness.

Conclusion: SRA-CP provides an efficient and practical solution for cooperative perception that balances communication efficiency with safety-critical perception performance in dynamic traffic environments.

Abstract: Cooperative perception (CP) offers significant potential to overcome the limitations of single-vehicle sensing by enabling information sharing among connected vehicles (CVs). However, existing generic CP approaches need to transmit large volumes of perception data that are irrelevant to the driving safety, exceeding available communication bandwidth. Moreover, most CP frameworks rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments. This paper proposes a Spontaneous Risk-Aware Selective Cooperative Perception (SRA-CP) framework to address these challenges. SRA-CP introduces a decentralized protocol where connected agents continuously broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. A perceptual risk identification module enables each CV to locally assess the impact of occlusions on its driving task and determine whether cooperation is necessary. When CP is triggered, the ego vehicle selects appropriate peers based on shared perception coverage and engages in selective information exchange through a fusion module that prioritizes safety-critical content and adapts to bandwidth constraints. We evaluate SRA-CP on a public dataset against several representative baselines. Results show that SRA-CP achieves less than 1% average precision (AP) loss for safety-critical objects compared to generic CP, while using only 20% of the communication bandwidth. Moreover, it improves the perception performance by 15% over existing selective CP methods that do not incorporate risk awareness.
