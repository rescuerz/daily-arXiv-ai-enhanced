As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper addresses the sim-to-real gap in cyber physical systems testing by developing a method to validate simulated failure scenarios using real-world sensor data, with a formal definition and querying algorithm that outperforms existing commercial vision models.", "motivation": "To bridge the sim-to-real gap in CPS testing by verifying whether failure scenarios discovered in simulation environments are reproducible in real-world systems using actual sensor data.", "method": "Introduces a formal definition for matching labeled time series sensor data to abstract scenarios using Scenic probabilistic programming language, and presents a querying algorithm to identify matching data subsets in real-world datasets.", "result": "The algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and scales effectively with the duration of queried time series data.", "conclusion": "The proposed approach provides an effective method for validating simulated failure scenarios against real-world data, addressing the critical sim-to-real gap in cyber physical systems testing."}}

We introduce encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that exhibit superior training efficiency characteristics and achieve higher compression than causal transformers even when trained on modest hardware. We demonstrate how entropy estimates can be obtained on a per-token basis, and show that the generalization of models trained to approach the entropy of their training data necessarily exceeds the generalization of models trained to minimize loss beyond this value.
