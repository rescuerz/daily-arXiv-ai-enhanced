### [1] [Efficient Multi-Hop Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs via LLM Planning and Embedding-Guided Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19648)
*Manil Shrestha,Edward Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hybrid algorithms for efficient multi-hop QA over knowledge graphs using LLM-guided planning and embedding-based neural search, achieving high accuracy with verifiable grounding and significant speed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational challenges in multi-hop QA over knowledge graphs, particularly the combinatorial explosion of reasoning paths and expensive LLM inference costs, while ensuring verifiable grounding in structured knowledge.

Method: Two complementary approaches: (1) LLM-Guided Planning using single LLM call for relation sequence prediction executed via breadth-first search, (2) Embedding-Guided Neural Search eliminating LLM calls by fusing text and graph embeddings with lightweight edge scorer. Also uses knowledge distillation to compress planning capability.

Result: Achieved near-perfect accuracy (micro-F1 > 0.90) with grounded answers, over 100 times speedup with competitive accuracy, and successfully compressed planning into 4B-parameter model matching large-model performance at zero API cost. Grounded reasoning consistently outperformed ungrounded generation on MetaQA.

Conclusion: Verifiable multi-hop reasoning doesn't require massive models at inference time but benefits from architectural inductive biases combining symbolic structure with learned representations, with structured planning proving more transferable than direct answer generation.

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering over knowledge graphs remains computationally challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of possible reasoning paths. Recent approaches rely on expensive Large Language Model (LLM) inference for both entity linking and path ranking, limiting their practical deployment. Additionally, LLM-generated answers often lack verifiable grounding in structured knowledge. We present two complementary hybrid algorithms that address both efficiency and verifiability: (1) LLM-Guided Planning that uses a single LLM call to predict relation sequences executed via breadth-first search, achieving near-perfect accuracy (micro-F1 > 0.90) while ensuring all answers are grounded in the knowledge graph, and (2) Embedding-Guided Neural Search that eliminates LLM calls entirely by fusing text and graph embeddings through a lightweight 6.7M-parameter edge scorer, achieving over 100 times speedup with competitive accuracy. Through knowledge distillation, we compress planning capability into a 4B-parameter model that matches large-model performance at zero API cost. Evaluation on MetaQA demonstrates that grounded reasoning consistently outperforms ungrounded generation, with structured planning proving more transferable than direct answer generation. Our results show that verifiable multi-hop reasoning does not require massive models at inference time, but rather the right architectural inductive biases combining symbolic structure with learned representations.

*Mobina Mehrazar,Mohammad Amin Yousefi,Parisa Abolfath Beygi,Behnam Bahrak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations for emotion classification in Persian, finding that while models perform well on classification, their explanations often diverge from human reasoning and show poor faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations in low-resource languages like Persian, particularly in emotion classification tasks where model transparency is crucial.

Method: Compared LLM-generated explanations against human annotations using confidence scores from token-level log-probabilities, testing two prompting strategies: Predict-then-Explain and Explain-then-Predict.

Result: LLMs achieved strong classification performance but their explanations showed poor faithfulness, with greater agreement among models than with human judgments, and no significant difference between the two prompting strategies.

Conclusion: Current explanation methods and metrics have limitations in ensuring faithful reasoning, highlighting the need for more robust approaches to ensure LLM reliability in multilingual and low-resource contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate self-explanations alongside their predictions, a practice that raises concerns about the faithfulness of these explanations, especially in low-resource languages. This study evaluates the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations in the context of emotion classification in Persian, a low-resource language, by comparing the influential words identified by the model against those identified by human annotators. We assess faithfulness using confidence scores derived from token-level log-probabilities. Two prompting strategies, differing in the order of explanation and prediction (Predict-then-Explain and Explain-then-Predict), are tested for their impact on explanation faithfulness. Our results reveal that while LLMs achieve strong classification performance, their generated explanations often diverge from faithful reasoning, showing greater agreement with each other than with human judgments. These results highlight the limitations of current explanation methods and metrics, emphasizing the need for more robust approaches to ensure LLM reliability in multilingual and low-resource contexts.

### [3] [Comparative Analysis of LoRA-Adapted Embedding Models for Clinical Cardiology Text Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19739)
*Richard J. Young,Alice M. Matthews*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Encoder-only models like BioLinkBERT outperform larger decoder-based models in cardiology text embeddings while using fewer computational resources, challenging the assumption that bigger models are always better for domain-specific tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of systematic comparisons across model architectures for clinical NLP, and domain-specific text embeddings are crucial for medical applications but current approaches don't adequately evaluate different transformer architectures.

Method: Evaluated ten transformer-based embedding models adapted for cardiology using LoRA fine-tuning on 106,535 cardiology text pairs from authoritative medical textbooks.

Result: Encoder-only architectures, particularly BioLinkBERT, achieved superior domain-specific performance (separation score: 0.510) compared to larger decoder-based models while requiring significantly fewer computational resources.

Conclusion: Larger language models don't necessarily produce better domain-specific embeddings; encoder-only models are more effective and efficient for clinical NLP, providing practical guidance for medical informatics development.

Abstract: Domain-specific text embeddings are critical for clinical natural language processing, yet systematic comparisons across model architectures remain limited. This study evaluates ten transformer-based embedding models adapted for cardiology through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on 106,535 cardiology text pairs derived from authoritative medical textbooks. Results demonstrate that encoder-only architectures, particularly BioLinkBERT, achieve superior domain-specific performance (separation score: 0.510) compared to larger decoder-based models, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. The findings challenge the assumption that larger language models necessarily produce better domain-specific embeddings and provide practical guidance for clinical NLP system development. All models, training code, and evaluation datasets are publicly available to support reproducible research in medical informatics.

### [4] [What does it mean to understand language?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19757)
*Colton Casto,Anna Ivanova,Evelina Fedorenko,Nancy Kanwisher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language understanding requires constructing rich mental models beyond surface-level meaning, involving information export from the brain's limited language system to other regions for perceptual, motor, and memory processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain how deep language understanding occurs despite fundamental limitations in the brain's core language system, proposing that information export to other brain regions is necessary.

Method: Review of existing evidence and recent progress in cognitive neuroscience that provides conceptual foundation and methods to test the hypothesis.

Result: The paper establishes that language processing requires collaboration between the core language system and other brain regions that handle perception, motor functions, mental models, world knowledge, and autobiographical memories.

Conclusion: Recent advances in cognitive neuroscience enable direct testing of the hypothesis that deep language understanding requires exporting information from the language system to other brain regions, opening new strategies to reveal the cognitive and neural basis of language comprehension.

Abstract: Language understanding entails not just extracting the surface-level meaning of the linguistic input, but constructing rich mental models of the situation it describes. Here we propose that because processing within the brain's core language system is fundamentally limited, deeply understanding language requires exporting information from the language system to other brain regions that compute perceptual and motor representations, construct mental models, and store our world knowledge and autobiographical memories. We review the existing evidence for this hypothesis, and argue that recent progress in cognitive neuroscience provides both the conceptual foundation and the methods to directly test it, thus opening up a new strategy to reveal what it means, cognitively and neurally, to understand language.

### [5] [Gender Bias in Emotion Recognition by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19785)
*Maureen Herbert,Katie Sun,Angelica Lim,Yasaman Etesam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines gender bias in LLMs' emotional theory of mind capabilities and evaluates debiasing strategies, finding that training-based interventions are more effective than prompt engineering alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become increasingly integrated into daily life, it's crucial to evaluate and ensure their fairness, particularly in sensitive areas like emotional understanding where biases could have real-world consequences.

Method: The researchers investigated whether LLMs exhibit gender biases when asked to infer emotions from descriptions of people and their environments, and proposed/evaluated multiple debiasing strategies including prompt engineering and training-based interventions.

Result: The study found that meaningful reductions in gender bias require training-based interventions rather than relying solely on inference-time prompt-based approaches like prompt engineering.

Conclusion: Training-based debiasing methods are necessary for effectively reducing gender bias in LLMs' emotional theory of mind capabilities, as prompt engineering alone is insufficient for achieving meaningful fairness improvements.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and their growing integration into daily life underscore the importance of evaluating and ensuring their fairness. In this work, we examine fairness within the domain of emotional theory of mind, investigating whether LLMs exhibit gender biases when presented with a description of a person and their environment and asked, "How does this person feel?". Furthermore, we propose and evaluate several debiasing strategies, demonstrating that achieving meaningful reductions in bias requires training based interventions rather than relying solely on inference-time prompt-based approaches such as prompt engineering.

### [6] [Breaking Bad: Norms for Valence, Arousal, and Dominance for over 10k English Multiword Expressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19816)
*Saif M. Mohammad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents NRC VAD Lexicon v2, which expands the original lexicon by adding human ratings for 10k English Multiword Expressions (MWEs) and their constituent words, plus 25k additional words, increasing coverage of modern vocabulary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To complement existing VAD lexicons by including Multiword Expressions and expanding word coverage, especially for words that have become more common since 2018, enabling broader research applications.

Method: Created human ratings for valence, arousal, and dominance for 10k English MWEs and their constituent words, plus additional unigrams, building on the original NRC VAD Lexicon v1.

Result: The new lexicon contains entries for 10k MWEs and 25k words in addition to v1 entries, with highly reliable associations. Analysis shows emotional characteristics of MWEs including emotionality strength and compositionality.

Conclusion: The expanded NRC VAD Lexicon v2 enables diverse research in NLP, Psychology, Public Health, Digital Humanities, and Social Sciences, and is freely available online.

Abstract: Factor analysis studies have shown that the primary dimensions of word meaning are Valence (V), Arousal (A), and Dominance (D). Existing lexicons such as the NRC VAD Lexicon, published in 2018, include VAD association ratings for words. Here, we present a complement to it, which has human ratings of valence, arousal, and dominance for 10k English Multiword Expressions (MWEs) and their constituent words. We also increase the coverage of unigrams, especially words that have become more common since 2018. In all, the new NRC VAD Lexicon v2 now has entries for 10k MWEs and 25k words, in addition to the entries in v1. We show that the associations are highly reliable. We use the lexicon to examine emotional characteristics of MWEs, including: 1. The degree to which MWEs (idioms, noun compounds, and verb particle constructions) exhibit strong emotionality; 2. The degree of emotional compositionality in MWEs. The lexicon enables a wide variety of research in NLP, Psychology, Public Health, Digital Humanities, and Social Sciences. The NRC VAD Lexicon v2 is freely available through the project webpage: http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/nrc-vad.html

### [7] [Language-Independent Sentiment Labelling with Distant Supervision: A Case Study for English, Sepedi and Setswana](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19818)
*Koena Ronny Mabokela,Tim Schlippe,Mpho Raborife,Turgay Celik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents an automatic language-independent sentiment labeling method using emojis and sentiment-bearing words, tested on English, Sepedi and Setswana tweets from the SAfriSenti corpus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: African languages are low-resource with limited labeled sentiment data, and manual labeling is time-consuming and expensive, requiring efficient automated solutions.

Method: Leverages sentiment-bearing emojis and words for automatic sentiment labeling in a language-independent approach.

Result: Achieved 66% accuracy for English, 69% for Sepedi, and 63% for Setswana tweets, requiring manual correction for only 34% of automatically generated labels on average.

Conclusion: The proposed sentiment labeling approach effectively reduces manual effort in sentiment analysis for low-resource African languages.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a helpful task to automatically analyse opinions and emotions on various topics in areas such as AI for Social Good, AI in Education or marketing. While many of the sentiment analysis systems are developed for English, many African languages are classified as low-resource languages due to the lack of digital language resources like text labelled with corresponding sentiment classes. One reason for that is that manually labelling text data is time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, automatic and rapid processes are needed to reduce the manual effort as much as possible making the labelling process as efficient as possible. In this paper, we present and analyze an automatic language-independent sentiment labelling method that leverages information from sentiment-bearing emojis and words. Our experiments are conducted with tweets in the languages English, Sepedi and Setswana from SAfriSenti, a multilingual sentiment corpus for South African languages. We show that our sentiment labelling approach is able to label the English tweets with an accuracy of 66%, the Sepedi tweets with 69%, and the Setswana tweets with 63%, so that on average only 34% of the automatically generated labels remain to be corrected.

### [8] [Profile-LLM: Dynamic Profile Optimization for Realistic Personality Expression in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19852)
*Shi-Wei Dai,Yan-Wei Shie,Tsung-Huan Yang,Lun-Wei Ku,Yung-Hui Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaPulse is a framework that optimizes prompts to maximize personality expression in LLMs using iterative enhancement and situational response benchmarks, outperforming previous methods based on psychological descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies used prompts to elicit personality traits in LLMs but didn't optimize them to maximize personality expression, creating a need for better prompt optimization methods.

Method: Leverages LLMs' inherent knowledge of personality traits to iteratively enhance role-play prompts while using a situational response benchmark as a scoring tool for realistic, contextually grounded evaluation.

Result: Quantitative evaluations show PersonaPulse-generated prompts outperform prior work, and experiments reveal relationships between model size and personality modeling, plus the ability to control personality evocation by pausing optimization.

Conclusion: Prompt optimization is crucial for shaping personality expression in LLMs, offering insights for future adaptive AI interaction research.

Abstract: Personalized Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be an effective way to create more engaging and enjoyable user-AI interactions. While previous studies have explored using prompts to elicit specific personality traits in LLMs, they have not optimized these prompts to maximize personality expression. To address this limitation, we propose PersonaPulse: Dynamic Profile Optimization for Realistic Personality Expression in LLMs, a framework that leverages LLMs' inherent knowledge of personality traits to iteratively enhance role-play prompts while integrating a situational response benchmark as a scoring tool, ensuring a more realistic and contextually grounded evaluation to guide the optimization process. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the prompts generated by PersonaPulse outperform those of prior work, which were designed based on personality descriptions from psychological studies. Additionally, we explore the relationship between model size and personality modeling through extensive experiments. Finally, we find that, for certain personality traits, the extent of personality evocation can be partially controlled by pausing the optimization process. These findings underscore the importance of prompt optimization in shaping personality expression within LLMs, offering valuable insights for future research on adaptive AI interactions.

### [9] [A Systematic Analysis of Large Language Models with RAG-enabled Dynamic Prompting for Medical Error Detection and Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19858)
*Farzad Ahmed,Joniel Augustine Jerome,Meliha Yetisgen,Özlem Uzuner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates different prompting strategies (zero-shot, static prompting with random exemplars, and retrieval-augmented dynamic prompting) for medical error processing tasks using nine LLMs, finding that retrieval-augmented dynamic prompting performs best across all models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical documentation contains errors that compromise patient safety, and LLMs could help detect and correct these errors, but their performance under different prompting strategies is unclear.

Method: Used MEDEC dataset to evaluate nine instruction-tuned LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini, OpenAI o-series) on three subtasks: error flag detection, error sentence detection, and error correction. Measured performance using accuracy, recall, FPR, and aggregate scores for error correction.

Result: Zero-shot prompting had low recall, missing abbreviation-heavy or atypical errors. Static prompting improved recall but increased FPR. Retrieval-augmented dynamic prompting reduced FPR by ~15%, improved recall by 5-10% in error sentence detection, and generated more contextually accurate corrections.

Conclusion: Retrieval-augmented dynamic prompting outperforms other methods across diverse LLMs, improving detection accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing reliability of medical error correction.

Abstract: Objective: Clinical documentation contains factual, diagnostic, and management errors that can compromise patient safety. Large language models (LLMs) may help detect and correct such errors, but their behavior under different prompting strategies remains unclear. We evaluate zero-shot prompting, static prompting with random exemplars (SPR), and retrieval-augmented dynamic prompting (RDP) for three subtasks of medical error processing: error flag detection, error sentence detection, and error correction.
  Methods: Using the MEDEC dataset, we evaluated nine instruction-tuned LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI o-series models). We measured performance using accuracy, recall, false-positive rate (FPR), and an aggregate score of ROUGE-1, BLEURT, and BERTScore for error correction. We also analyzed example outputs to identify failure modes and differences between LLM and clinician reasoning.
  Results: Zero-shot prompting showed low recall in both detection tasks, often missing abbreviation-heavy or atypical errors. SPR improved recall but increased FPR. Across all nine LLMs, RDP reduced FPR by about 15 percent, improved recall by 5 to 10 percent in error sentence detection, and generated more contextually accurate corrections.
  Conclusion: Across diverse LLMs, RDP outperforms zero-shot and SPR prompting. Using retrieved exemplars improves detection accuracy, reduces false positives, and enhances the reliability of medical error correction.

### [10] [AppSelectBench: Application-Level Tool Selection Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19957)
*Tianyi Chen,Michael Solodko,Sen Wang,Jongwoo Ko,Junheng Hao,Colby Banbury,Sara Abdali,Saeed Amizadeh,Qing Xiao,Yinheng Li,Tianyu Ding,Kamran Ghasedi Dizaji,Suzhen Zheng,Hao Fan,Justin Wagle,Pashmina Cameron,Kazuhito Koishida*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AppSelectBench is a new benchmark for evaluating application selection in Computer Using Agents (CUAs), addressing the gap in assessing inter-application reasoning rather than just fine-grained API selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks focus on fine-grained API selection but don't evaluate whether models can reason across and choose between different applications, which is crucial for CUAs to operate effectively by initializing correct environments and avoiding orchestration confusion.

Method: Developed a user task generation pipeline that produces realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user intents at scale, with unified evaluation protocols covering random, heuristic, zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented settings across 100 desktop applications.

Result: The benchmark includes over 100,000 realistic user tasks and extensive experiments reveal systematic strengths and weaknesses in inter-application reasoning, showing even the most capable models struggle with consistent application choices.

Conclusion: AppSelectBench establishes a foundation for studying and advancing application-level reasoning, an essential yet underexplored capability of intelligent CUAs.

Abstract: Computer Using Agents (CUAs) are increasingly equipped with external tools, enabling them to perform complex and realistic tasks. For CUAs to operate effectively, application selection, which refers to deciding which application to use before invoking fine-grained tools such as APIs, is a fundamental capability. It determines whether the agent initializes the correct environment, avoids orchestration confusion, and efficiently focuses on relevant context. However, existing benchmarks primarily assess fine-grained API selection, offering limited insight into whether models can reason across and choose between different applications. To fill this gap, we introduce AppSelectBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating application selection in CUAs. AppSelectBench contains a novel user task generation pipeline that produces realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user intents at scale, together with unified evaluation protocols covering random, heuristic, zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented-settings. AppSelectBench covers one hundred widely used desktop applications and includes more than one hundred thousand realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user tasks. Extensive experiments across both closed-source and open-source large language models reveal systematic strengths and weaknesses in inter-application reasoning, showing that even the most capable models still struggle to make consistent application choices. Together, these results establish AppSelectBench as a foundation for studying and advancing application level reasoning, an essential yet underexplored capability of intelligent CUAs.

### [11] [$\text{R}^2\text{R}$: A Route-to-Rerank Post-Training Framework for Multi-Domain Decoder-Only Rerankers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19987)
*Xinyu Wang,Hanwei Wu,Qingchen Hu,Zhenghan Tai,Jingrui Tian,Lei Ding,Jijun Chi,Hailin He,Tung Sum Thomas Kwok,Yufei Cui,Sicheng Lyu,Muzhi Li,Mingze Li,Xinyue Yu,Ling Zhou,Peng Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R2R is a domain-aware reranking framework that uses dynamic expert routing and Entity Abstraction for Generalization (EAG) training to improve domain-specific performance in high-stakes fields like finance and law without overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist reranker models miss domain-specific nuances in critical fields, while naive fine-tuning causes surface-form overfitting and catastrophic forgetting of general capabilities.

Method: Combines dynamic expert routing with two-stage EAG training that masks predictive surface cues to force learning domain-invariant relevance patterns, plus a lightweight Latent Semantic Router to select optimal LoRA experts per query.

Result: Extensive experiments across legal, medical, and financial domains show R2R consistently outperforms generalist and single-domain fine-tuned baselines across different reranker backbones.

Conclusion: R2R provides a model-agnostic, modular approach to domain specialization with strong cross-domain robustness, effectively addressing domain-specific reranking challenges.

Abstract: Decoder-only rerankers are central to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, generalist models miss domain-specific nuances in high-stakes fields like finance and law, and naive fine-tuning causes surface-form overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we introduce R2R, a domain-aware framework that combines dynamic expert routing with a two-stage training strategy, Entity Abstraction for Generalization (EAG). EAG introduces a counter-shortcut mechanism by masking the most predictive surface cues, forcing the reranker to learn domain-invariant relevance patterns rather than memorizing dataset-specific entities. To efficiently activate domain experts, R2R employs a lightweight Latent Semantic Router that probes internal representations from the frozen backbone decoder to select the optimal LoRA expert per query. Extensive experiments across different reranker backbones and diverse domains (legal, medical, and financial) demonstrate that R2R consistently surpasses generalist and single-domain fine-tuned baselines. Our results confirm that R2R is a model-agnostic and modular approach to domain specialization with strong cross-domain robustness.

### [12] [Directional Optimization Asymmetry in Transformers: A Synthetic Stress Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19997)
*Mihir Sahasrabudhe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformers exhibit a directional optimization gap even in synthetic, entropy-controlled settings, showing that reversal difficulty is intrinsic to causal Transformer architecture rather than just linguistic statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve whether directional failures in Transformers stem from linguistic statistics or the architecture itself, by creating a clean-room synthetic benchmark that removes real-world corpus biases.

Method: Used random string mappings with tunable branching factor K to construct forward tasks (zero conditional entropy) and inverse tasks (analytically determined entropy floors), testing scratch-trained GPT-2 models and comparing with MLP baselines.

Result: Found strong directional optimization gap (1.16 nats at K=5) in Transformers, larger than MLP on same data. Pre-training shifts but doesn't eliminate gap, and LoRA hits capacity wall on high-entropy inversions.

Conclusion: Identified a minimal, semantics-free signature of directional friction intrinsic to causal Transformer training that persists even when linguistic priors and temporal asymmetries are removed.

Abstract: Transformers are theoretically reversal-invariant: their function class does not prefer left-to-right over right-to-left mappings. Yet empirical studies on natural language repeatedly report a "reversal curse," and recent work on temporal asymmetry in LLMs suggests that real-world corpora carry their own arrow of time. This leaves an unresolved question: do directional failures stem from linguistic statistics, or from the architecture itself? We cut through this ambiguity with a fully synthetic, entropy-controlled benchmark designed as a clean-room stress test for directional learning. Using random string mappings with tunable branching factor K, we construct forward tasks with zero conditional entropy and inverse tasks with analytically determined entropy floors. Excess loss above these floors reveals that even scratch-trained GPT-2 models exhibit a strong, reproducible directional optimization gap (e.g., 1.16 nats at K=5), far larger than that of an MLP trained on the same data. Pre-trained initializations shift optimization behavior but do not eliminate this gap, while LoRA encounters a sharp capacity wall on high-entropy inverse mappings. Together, these results isolate a minimal, semantics-free signature of directional friction intrinsic to causal Transformer training-one that persists even when linguistic priors, token frequencies, and corpus-level temporal asymmetries are removed. Our benchmark provides a controlled instrument for dissecting directional biases in modern sequence models and motivates deeper mechanistic study of why inversion remains fundamentally harder for Transformers.

### [13] [A Machine Learning Approach for Detection of Mental Health Conditions and Cyberbullying from Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20001)
*Edward Ajayi,Martha Kachweka,Mawuli Deku,Emily Aiken*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified multiclass classification framework for detecting 10 mental health and cyberbullying categories from social media data, using domain-adapted MentalBERT as the top-performing model with 0.92 accuracy and 0.76 Macro F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing prevalence of mental health challenges and cyberbullying in digital spaces by developing scalable, interpretable detection systems for social media content.

Method: Curated datasets from Twitter and Reddit using 'split-then-balance' pipeline, compared traditional lexical models, hybrid approaches, and fine-tuned transformers. Introduced hybrid SHAPLLM explainability framework and prototype dashboard.

Result: End-to-end fine-tuning proved critical, with MentalBERT achieving best performance (0.92 accuracy, 0.76 Macro F1), surpassing generic models and zero-shot LLM baseline. Framework designed as human-in-the-loop screening aid.

Conclusion: Provides robust baseline for mental health and cyberbullying detection, highlighting need for multi-label clinically-validated datasets at intersection of online safety and computational mental health.

Abstract: Mental health challenges and cyberbullying are increasingly prevalent in digital spaces, necessitating scalable and interpretable detection systems. This paper introduces a unified multiclass classification framework for detecting ten distinct mental health and cyberbullying categories from social media data. We curate datasets from Twitter and Reddit, implementing a rigorous "split-then-balance" pipeline to train on balanced data while evaluating on a realistic, held-out imbalanced test set. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation comparing traditional lexical models, hybrid approaches, and several end-to-end fine-tuned transformers. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end fine-tuning is critical for performance, with the domain-adapted MentalBERT emerging as the top model, achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a Macro F1 score of 0.76, surpassing both its generic counterpart and a zero-shot LLM baseline. Grounded in a comprehensive ethical analysis, we frame the system as a human-in-the-loop screening aid, not a diagnostic tool. To support this, we introduce a hybrid SHAPLLM explainability framework and present a prototype dashboard ("Social Media Screener") designed to integrate model predictions and their explanations into a practical workflow for moderators. Our work provides a robust baseline, highlighting future needs for multi-label, clinically-validated datasets at the critical intersection of online safety and computational mental health.

### [14] [Online-PVLM: Advancing Personalized VLMs with Online Concept Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20056)
*Huiyu Bai,Runze Wang,Zhuoyun Du,Yiyang Zhao,Fengji Zhang,Haoyu Chen,Xiaoyong Zhu,Bo Zheng,Xuejiao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Online-PVLM is a framework for online concept learning in personalized visual language models using hyperbolic representations, enabling train-free concept embedding generation at test time for scalable and efficient personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for personalized VLMs require separate embeddings for each concept and fail to support real-time adaptation during testing, which becomes problematic in large-scale scenarios where efficient retrieval is needed.

Method: Proposed Online-PVLM framework leveraging hyperbolic representations for online concept learning, enabling train-free generation of concept embeddings at test time without requiring separate training for each new concept.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and the framework is evaluated using OP-Eval benchmark comprising 1,292 concepts and over 30K high-quality instances with diverse question types.

Conclusion: Online-PVLM provides a scalable and efficient solution for online concept learning in personalized VLMs, addressing limitations of existing methods that cannot support real-time adaptation during testing.

Abstract: Personalized Visual Language Models (VLMs) are gaining increasing attention for their formidable ability in user-specific concepts aligned interactions (e.g., identifying a user's bike). Existing methods typically require the learning of separate embeddings for each new concept, which fails to support real-time adaptation during testing. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced in large-scale scenarios, where efficient retrieval of concept embeddings is not achievable. To alleviate this gap, we propose Online-PVLM, a framework for online concept learning by leveraging hyperbolic representations. Our approach makes a train-free paradigm for concept embeddings generation at test time, making the use of personalized VLMs both scalable and efficient. In addition, we develop OP-Eval, a comprehensive and large-scale benchmark comprising 1,292 concepts and over 30K high-quality instances with diverse question types, designed to rigorously assess online concept learning in realistic scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed framework. Our source code and dataset will be made available.

Motivation: Current PLLM approaches face scalability issues (linear storage costs with users) and poor performance for users with sparse data when fine-tuning static models from scratch.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Construct shared Meta-LoRA Bank with pre-trained meta-personalization traits, 2) Adaptive LoRA Fusion to dynamically merge relevant meta-LoRAs for user-specific synthesis, 3) LoRA Stacking with ultra-low-rank module for few-shot personalization.

Result: Extensive experiments on LaMP benchmark show MTA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple tasks.

Conclusion: MTA provides an effective solution for scalable and flexible personalization in LLMs, eliminating user-specific storage requirements and enabling effective personalization even with sparse user data.

Abstract: Personalized Large Language Models (PLLMs) aim to align model outputs with individual user preferences, a crucial capability for user-centric applications. However, the prevalent approach of fine-tuning a separate module for each user faces two major limitations: (1) storage costs scale linearly with the number of users, rendering the method unscalable; and (2) fine-tuning a static model from scratch often yields suboptimal performance for users with sparse data. To address these challenges, we propose MTA, a Merge-then-Adapt framework for PLLMs. MTA comprises three key stages. First, we construct a shared Meta-LoRA Bank by selecting anchor users and pre-training meta-personalization traits within meta-LoRA modules. Second, to ensure scalability and enable dynamic personalization combination beyond static models, we introduce an Adaptive LoRA Fusion stage. This stage retrieves and dynamically merges the most relevant anchor meta-LoRAs to synthesize a user-specific one, thereby eliminating the need for user-specific storage and supporting more flexible personalization. Third, we propose a LoRA Stacking for Few-Shot Personalization stage, which applies an additional ultra-low-rank, lightweight LoRA module on top of the merged LoRA. Fine-tuning this module enables effective personalization under few-shot settings. Extensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing SOTA methods across multiple tasks.

TL;DR: BiasPrompting is a novel inference framework that improves LLM performance on multiple-choice questions by generating and evaluating reasoning for all answer options before final prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches present answer choices to LLMs without contextual grounding or explanation, leading to incomplete exploration of possible answers and degraded reasoning capabilities.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) reasoning generation stage where LLMs produce supportive reasoning for each answer option, (2) reasoning-guided agreement stage where generated reasonings are synthesized to select the most plausible answer.

Result: Significant improvements in five widely used multiple-choice question answering benchmarks, enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities particularly in challenging settings where existing methods underperform.

Conclusion: BiasPrompting provides a strong foundation for tackling complex multiple-choice questions by systematically exploring all plausible answer options through reasoning generation and evaluation.

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), their performance on multiple-choice question (MCQ) tasks has improved significantly. However, existing approaches face key limitations: answer choices are typically presented to LLMs without contextual grounding or explanation. This absence of context can lead to incomplete exploration of all possible answers, ultimately degrading the models' reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce BiasPrompting, a novel inference framework that guides LLMs to generate and critically evaluate reasoning across all plausible answer options before reaching a final prediction. It consists of two components: first, a reasoning generation stage, where the model is prompted to produce supportive reasonings for each answer option, and then, a reasoning-guided agreement stage, where the generated reasonings are synthesized to select the most plausible answer. Through comprehensive evaluations, BiasPrompting demonstrates significant improvements in five widely used multiple-choice question answering benchmarks. Our experiments showcase that BiasPrompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and provides a strong foundation for tackling complex and challenging questions, particularly in settings where existing methods underperform.

### [17] [SSA: Sparse Sparse Attention by Aligning Full and Sparse Attention Outputs in Feature Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20102)
*Zhenyi Shen,Junru Lu,Lin Gui,Jiazheng Li,Yulan He,Di Yin,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSA is a training framework that addresses gradient deficiency in sparse attention by enforcing bidirectional alignment between sparse and full attention, achieving state-of-the-art performance while enabling flexible compute-performance trade-offs and improved long-context extrapolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sparse attention methods suffer from a paradox where they produce lower sparsity than full attention despite aiming to approximate it, due to gradient update deficiency where excluded key-value pairs never learn proper suppression.

Method: SSA uses a unified training framework that considers both sparse and full attention, enforcing bidirectional alignment at every layer to preserve gradient flow to all tokens while encouraging sparse-attention outputs to align with full-attention counterparts.

Result: SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance under both sparse and full attention inference across multiple commonsense benchmarks, enables smooth adaptation to varying sparsity budgets, and demonstrates the strongest extrapolation capability by mitigating over-allocation of attention values in sink areas.

Conclusion: SSA overcomes limitations of existing sparse attention methods through bidirectional alignment, achieving superior performance, flexible compute-performance trade-offs, and improved long-context extrapolation capabilities.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of full attention limits efficient long-context processing in large language models (LLMs). Sparse attention mitigates this cost by restricting each query to attend to a subset of previous tokens; however, training-free approaches often lead to severe performance degradation. Native sparse-attention methods (e.g., NSA, MoBA) alleviate this issue, yet exhibit a critical paradox: they produce lower attention sparsity than full-attention models, despite aiming to approximate full attention, which may constrain their effectiveness. We attribute this paradox to gradient update deficiency: low-ranked key-value pairs excluded during sparse training receive neither forward contribution nor backward gradients, and thus never learn proper suppression. To overcome this limitation, we propose SSA (Sparse Sparse Attention), a unified training framework that considers both sparse and full attention and enforces bidirectional alignment at every layer. This design preserves gradient flow to all tokens while explicitly encouraging sparse-attention outputs to align with their full-attention counterparts, thereby promoting stronger sparsity. As a result, SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance under both sparse and full attention inference across multiple commonsense benchmarks. Furthermore, SSA enables models to adapt smoothly to varying sparsity budgets; performance improves consistently as more tokens are allowed to attend, supporting flexible compute-performance trade-offs at inference time. Finally, we show that native sparse-attention training surprisingly improves long-context extrapolation by mitigating the over-allocation of attention values in sink areas, with SSA demonstrating the strongest extrapolation capability.

*Somsubhra De,Harsh Kumar,Arun Prakash A*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs with prompting strategies outperform fine-tuned Indic-language models for grammatical error correction in low-resource languages, achieving top rankings in multiple Indic languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grammatical error correction for Indic languages remains challenging due to limited resources, linguistic diversity, and complex morphology, while existing approaches mainly focus on high-resource languages like English.

Method: Used prompting-based approaches with state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5, LLaMA-4) combined with few-shot strategy, employing zero-shot and few-shot approaches with carefully designed prompts.

Result: Achieved leading results: 1st in Tamil (GLEU: 91.57) and Hindi (GLEU: 85.69), 2nd in Telugu (GLEU: 85.22), 4th in Bangla (GLEU: 92.86), and 5th in Malayalam (GLEU: 92.97), substantially outperforming fine-tuned Indic-language models.

Conclusion: Prompt-driven NLP techniques and large-scale LLMs effectively bridge resource gaps in multilingual GEC, demonstrating exceptional multilingual generalization capabilities for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Grammatical error correction (GEC) is an important task in Natural Language Processing that aims to automatically detect and correct grammatical mistakes in text. While recent advances in transformer-based models and large annotated datasets have greatly improved GEC performance for high-resource languages such as English, the progress has not extended equally. For most Indic languages, GEC remains a challenging task due to limited resources, linguistic diversity and complex morphology. In this work, we explore prompting-based approaches using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5 and LLaMA-4, combined with few-shot strategy to adapt them to low-resource settings. We observe that even basic prompting strategies, such as zero-shot and few-shot approaches, enable these LLMs to substantially outperform fine-tuned Indic-language models like Sarvam-22B, thereby illustrating the exceptional multilingual generalization capabilities of contemporary LLMs for GEC. Our experiments show that carefully designed prompts and lightweight adaptation significantly enhance correction quality across multiple Indic languages. We achieved leading results in the shared task--ranking 1st in Tamil (GLEU: 91.57) and Hindi (GLEU: 85.69), 2nd in Telugu (GLEU: 85.22), 4th in Bangla (GLEU: 92.86), and 5th in Malayalam (GLEU: 92.97). These findings highlight the effectiveness of prompt-driven NLP techniques and underscore the potential of large-scale LLMs to bridge resource gaps in multilingual GEC.

*Wen-Fang Su,Hsiao-Wei Chou,Wen-Yang Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating image data augmentation techniques into grid-tagging models to improve recognition of discontinuous named entities, achieving significant F1 score improvements on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NER methods struggle with discontinuous entities, particularly cross-sentence ones, due to segmentation issues that lead to misrecognition or omission, which negatively impacts overall accuracy.

Method: Integrates image data augmentation techniques (cropping, scaling, padding) into grid-tagging models to enhance their ability to handle discontinuous entities and segmentation challenges.

Result: Traditional segmentation methods fail to capture cross-sentence discontinuous entities, while the augmented grid models achieve F1 score gains of 1-2.5% overall and 3.7-8.4% specifically for discontinuous entities on CADEC, ShARe13, and ShARe14 datasets.

Conclusion: The integration of image data augmentation techniques into grid-based models effectively addresses segmentation and omission issues for discontinuous entities, demonstrating significant performance improvements in NER tasks.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task in natural language processing, yet it remains particularly challenging for discontinuous entities. The primary difficulty lies in text segmentation, as traditional methods often missegment or entirely miss cross-sentence discontinuous entities, significantly affecting recognition accuracy. Therefore, we aim to address the segmentation and omission issues associated with such entities. Recent studies have shown that grid-tagging methods are effective for information extraction due to their flexible tagging schemes and robust architectures. Building on this, we integrate image data augmentation techniques, such as cropping, scaling, and padding, into grid-based models to enhance their ability to recognize discontinuous entities and handle segmentation challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that traditional segmentation methods often fail to capture cross-sentence discontinuous entities, leading to decreased performance. In contrast, our augmented grid models achieve notable improvements. Evaluations on the CADEC, ShARe13, and ShARe14 datasets show F1 score gains of 1-2.5% overall and 3.7-8.4% for discontinuous entities, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

*Chuyi Kong,Gao Wei,Jing Ma,Hongzhan Lin,Zhiyuan Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REFLEX is a plug-and-play fact-checking paradigm that uses role-play dialogue and contrastive activation pairs to improve verdict accuracy and explanation quality without heavy reliance on external knowledge sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based fact-checking systems heavily depend on external knowledge, causing latency and hallucinations that undermine reliability, interpretability, and real-time responsiveness.

Method: Reformulates fact-checking as role-play dialogue, jointly trains verdict prediction and explanation generation, extracts contrastive activation pairs between backbone model and fine-tuned variant to create steering vectors that disentangle truth into style and substance.

Result: Outperforms previous methods that steer toward single truth direction, achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 465 self-refined training samples, and yields up to 7.57% improvement in guiding models without explanatory objectives.

Conclusion: Internal explanation signals play dual role in both interpreting and enhancing factual reasoning, enabling more faithful and efficient fact-checking without heavy external dependencies.

Abstract: The prevalence of misinformation on social media threatens public trust, demanding automated fact-checking systems that provide accurate verdicts with interpretable explanations. However, existing large language model-based (LLM-based) approaches often rely heavily on external knowledge sources, introducing substantial latency and even hallucinations that undermine reliability, interpretability, and responsiveness, which is crucial for real-time use. To address these challenges, we propose REason-guided Fact-checking with Latent EXplanations REFLEX paradigm, a plug-and-play, self-refining paradigm that leverages the internal knowledge in backbone model to improve both verdict accuracy and explanation quality. REFLEX reformulates fact-checking as a role-play dialogue and jointly trains verdict prediction and explanation generation. It adaptively extracts contrastive activation pairs between the backbone model and its fine-tuned variant to construct steering vectors that disentangle truth into style and substance naturally. These activation-level signals guide inference and suppress noisy explanations, enabling more faithful and efficient reasoning. Experiments on real-world datasets show that REFLEX outperforms previous methods that steer toward a single truth direction and underscores the challenge traditional approaches face when handling the subtle, human-unknown truth in fact-checking tasks. Remarkably, with only 465 self-refined training samples, RELFEX achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, models trained with explanatory objectives can effectively guide those without them, yielding up to a 7.57% improvement, highlighting that internal explanation signals play a dual role in both interpreting and enhancing factual reasoning.

*Luohe Shi,Zuchao Li,Lefei Zhang,Baoyuan Qi,Guoming Liu,Hai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpecFormer is a novel architecture that combines unidirectional and bidirectional attention to enable efficient speculative decoding for LLM inference, eliminating the need for large draft trees and achieving consistent acceleration even in large-batch scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speculative decoding methods require significant computing power and generate complex draft trees, but batching in model inference systems compresses idle computing power, making low-resource speculative decoding important. The authors argue that models capable of parallel generation on draft sequences are needed.

Method: Proposed SpecFormer architecture that integrates unidirectional and bidirectional attention mechanisms, combining autoregressive model's ability to extract information from entire input sequences with parallel generation benefits of non-autoregressive models.

Result: Through lossless speculative decoding experiments across various model scales, SpecFormer achieves consistent acceleration even in large-batch scenarios, setting a new standard for scaling LLM inference.

Conclusion: SpecFormer demonstrates lower training demands and reduced computational costs while providing efficient speculative decoding that doesn't rely on large prefix trees, making it suitable for practical inference systems.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by utilizing otherwise idle computational resources during memory-to-chip data transfer. Current speculative decoding methods typically assume a considerable amount of available computing power, then generate a complex and massive draft tree using a small autoregressive language model to improve overall prediction accuracy. However, methods like batching have been widely applied in mainstream model inference systems as a superior alternative to speculative decoding, as they compress the available idle computing power. Therefore, performing speculative decoding with low verification resources and low scheduling costs has become an important research problem. We believe that more capable models that allow for parallel generation on draft sequences are what we truly need. Recognizing the fundamental nature of draft models to only generate sequences of limited length, we propose SpecFormer, a novel architecture that integrates unidirectional and bidirectional attention mechanisms. SpecFormer combines the autoregressive model's ability to extract information from the entire input sequence with the parallel generation benefits of non-autoregressive models. This design eliminates the reliance on large prefix trees and achieves consistent acceleration, even in large-batch scenarios. Through lossless speculative decoding experiments across models of various scales, we demonstrate that SpecFormer sets a new standard for scaling LLM inference with lower training demands and reduced computational costs.

*Taewhoo Lee,Minju Song,Chanwoong Yoon,Jungwoo Park,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show emerging but limited capabilities in analogical reasoning - they can encode relational concepts but struggle to apply them to new entities, with success depending on structural alignment between analogous situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can encode high-level relational concepts and apply them to novel situations through structured comparisons, which is fundamental to human cognition.

Method: Using proportional and story analogies to analyze how LLMs encode relationships, examining information propagation through model layers, and testing strategic patching of hidden representations to facilitate information transfer.

Result: LLMs effectively encode underlying relationships between analogous entities when successful, but struggle when relational information is missing or when applying it to new entities. Strategic patching can help transfer information, and success correlates with strong structural alignment.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit emerging but limited analogical reasoning capabilities, showing parallels with human cognition in encoding relationships but gaps in applying them to novel situations, with structural alignment being crucial for success.

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is at the core of human cognition, serving as an important foundation for a variety of intellectual activities. While prior work has shown that LLMs can represent task patterns and surface-level concepts, it remains unclear whether these models can encode high-level relational concepts and apply them to novel situations through structured comparisons. In this work, we explore this fundamental aspect using proportional and story analogies, and identify three key findings. First, LLMs effectively encode the underlying relationships between analogous entities; both attributive and relational information propagate through mid-upper layers in correct cases, whereas reasoning failures reflect missing relational information within these layers. Second, unlike humans, LLMs often struggle not only when relational information is missing, but also when attempting to apply it to new entities. In such cases, strategically patching hidden representations at critical token positions can facilitate information transfer to a certain extent. Lastly, successful analogical reasoning in LLMs is marked by strong structural alignment between analogous situations, whereas failures often reflect degraded or misplaced alignment. Overall, our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit emerging but limited capabilities in encoding and applying high-level relational concepts, highlighting both parallels and gaps with human cognition.

TL;DR: BengaliFig is a Bengali challenge set with 435 culturally rich riddles to evaluate LLMs' figurative and cultural reasoning in low-resource contexts, revealing weaknesses in metaphorical and culturally specific reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating large language models on figurative and culturally grounded reasoning in low-resource languages like Bengali, which are often overlooked in broad multilingual benchmarks.

Method: Created a dataset of 435 Bengali riddles from oral and literary traditions, annotated along five dimensions (reasoning type, trap type, cultural depth, answer category, difficulty), and converted to multiple-choice format using an AI-assisted pipeline. Evaluated eight frontier LLMs with zero-shot and few-shot chain-of-thought prompting.

Result: Evaluation revealed consistent weaknesses in metaphorical and culturally specific reasoning across all tested LLMs, highlighting limitations in handling culturally grounded figurative language.

Conclusion: BengaliFig serves as both a diagnostic tool for assessing LLM robustness in low-resource cultural contexts and a step toward more inclusive, heritage-aware NLP evaluation that considers cultural and figurative reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models excel on broad multilingual benchmarks but remain to be evaluated extensively in figurative and culturally grounded reasoning, especially in low-resource contexts. We present BengaliFig, a compact yet richly annotated challenge set that targets this gap in Bengali, a widely spoken low-resourced language. The dataset contains 435 unique riddles drawn from Bengali oral and literary traditions. Each item is annotated along five orthogonal dimensions capturing reasoning type, trap type, cultural depth, answer category, and difficulty, and is automatically converted to multiple-choice format through a constraint-aware, AI-assisted pipeline. We evaluate eight frontier LLMs from major providers under zero-shot and few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, revealing consistent weaknesses in metaphorical and culturally specific reasoning. BengaliFig thus contributes both a diagnostic probe for evaluating LLM robustness in low-resource cultural contexts and a step toward inclusive and heritage-aware NLP evaluation.

### [27] [A Task-Oriented Evaluation Framework for Text Normalization in Modern NLP Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20409)
*Md Abdullah Al Kafi,Raka Moni,Sumit Kumar Banshal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel task-oriented evaluation framework for stemming methods that assesses utility (SES), downstream task impact (MPD), and semantic preservation (ANLD), revealing that high stemming effectiveness can be harmful when it causes over-stemming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation approaches for stemming methods are limited and fail to capture the potential harm caused by excessive stemming, necessitating the development of more comprehensive evaluation methods.

Method: The study proposes a three-pronged evaluation framework: Stemming Effectiveness Score (SES) for utility, Model Performance Delta (MPD) for downstream task impact, and Average Normalized Levenshtein Distance (ANLD) for semantic similarity between stemmed and original words.

Result: The Bangla stemmer achieved high SES (1.67) but poor ANLD (0.26), indicating harmful over-stemming that correlated with decreased downstream performance. The English stemmer achieved moderate SES (1.31) with safe ANLD (0.14), contributing positively to downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively distinguishes between efficiency gains (high SES) and meaning preservation (low ANLD), demonstrating that high stemming effectiveness can be detrimental when it involves over-stemming, and providing a valuable tool for evaluating stemmer reliability.

Abstract: Text normalization is an essential preprocessing step in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, and stemming is one such normalization technique that reduces words to their base or root form. However, evaluating stemming methods is challenging because current evaluation approaches are limited and do not capture the potential harm caused by excessive stemming; therefore, it is essential to develop new approaches to evaluate stemming methods. To address this issue, this study propose a novel, task-oriented approach to evaluate stemming methods, which considers three aspects: (1) the utility of stemming using Stemming Effectiveness Score (SES), (2) the impact of stemming on downstream tasks using Model Performance Delta (MPD), and (3) the semantic similarity between stemmed and original words using Average Normalized Levenshtein Distance (ANLD), thus providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. We apply our evaluation framework to compare two stemmers for Bangla (BNLTK) and English (Snowball), and our results reveal a significant issue, prompting us to analyze their performance in detail. While the Bangla stemmer achieves the highest SES (1.67) due to effective word reduction (CR = 1.90), SES alone is insufficient because our proposed safety measure, ANLD, reveals that this high SES is due to harmful over-stemming (ANLD = 0.26), which correlates with the observed decrease in downstream performance.In contrast, the English stemmer achieves a moderate SES (1.31) with a safe meaning distance (ANLD = 0.14), allowing its word reduction to contribute positively to downstream performance; therefore, it is a more reliable stemmer. Our study provides a valuable tool for distinguishing between potential efficiency gains (high SES) and meaning preservation (low ANLD).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This pilot study examines AI approaches for predicting pain spikes in patients with chronic pain and opioid use disorder using wearable device data, finding machine learning models perform well while LLMs show limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of evidence-based integrated treatments for chronic pain and opioid use disorder, and wearable devices combined with AI could help monitor pain variability and clinical correlates to improve treatment.

Method: Used wearable devices to monitor patient data and applied various AI approaches including machine learning models and large language models to examine clinical correlates of pain spikes.

Result: Machine learning models achieved relatively high accuracy (>0.7) in predicting pain spikes, while LLMs were limited in providing insights on pain spikes.

Conclusion: Real-time monitoring through wearables combined with AI could facilitate early detection of pain spikes and support personalized interventions, but LLMs need development to provide actionable insights in the OUD/CP context.

Abstract: Chronic pain (CP) and opioid use disorder (OUD) are common and interrelated chronic medical conditions. Currently, there is a paucity of evidence-based integrated treatments for CP and OUD among individuals receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Wearable devices have the potential to monitor complex patient information and inform treatment development for persons with OUD and CP, including pain variability (e.g., exacerbations of pain or pain spikes) and clinical correlates (e.g., perceived stress). However, the application of large language models (LLMs) with wearable data for understanding pain spikes, remains unexplored. Consequently, the aim of this pilot study was to examine the clinical correlates of pain spikes using a range of AI approaches. We found that machine learning models achieved relatively high accuracy (>0.7) in predicting pain spikes, while LLMs were limited in providing insights on pain spikes. Real-time monitoring through wearable devices, combined with advanced AI models, could facilitate early detection of pain spikes and support personalized interventions that may help mitigate the risk of opioid relapse, improve adherence to MOUD, and enhance the integration of CP and OUD care. Given overall limited LLM performance, these findings highlight the need to develop LLMs which can provide actionable insights in the OUD/CP context.

TL;DR: FaraGen is a synthetic data generation system that creates diverse multi-step web tasks and verified trajectories for computer use agents. Using this data, they trained Fara-7B, a native CUA model that outperforms comparable models and competes with larger frontier models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in computer use agents has been constrained by the absence of large, high-quality datasets capturing human-computer interactions, unlike the abundant textual data available for LLMs.

Method: FaraGen system proposes diverse tasks from frequently used websites, generates multiple solution attempts, and filters successful trajectories using multiple verifiers. The data is used to train Fara-7B, a native CUA model that perceives computers through screenshots and executes actions via predicted coordinates.

Result: FaraGen achieves high throughput, yield, and diversity for multi-step web tasks, producing verified trajectories at approximately $1 each. Fara-7B outperforms other CUA models of comparable size on benchmarks like WebVoyager, Online-Mind2Web, and WebTailBench, and is competitive with much larger frontier models.

Conclusion: Scalable data generation systems like FaraGen are crucial for advancing small, efficient agentic models. The authors are releasing Fara-7B as open-weight and publishing WebTailBench benchmark.

Abstract: Progress in computer use agents (CUAs) has been constrained by the absence of large and high-quality datasets that capture how humans interact with a computer. While LLMs have thrived on abundant textual data, no comparable corpus exists for CUA trajectories. To address these gaps, we introduce FaraGen, a novel synthetic data generation system for multi-step web tasks. FaraGen can propose diverse tasks from frequently used websites, generate multiple solution attempts, and filter successful trajectories using multiple verifiers. It achieves high throughput, yield, and diversity for multi-step web tasks, producing verified trajectories at approximately $1 each. We use this data to train Fara-7B, a native CUA model that perceives the computer using only screenshots, executes actions via predicted coordinates, and is small enough to run on-device. We find that Fara-7B outperforms other CUA models of comparable size on benchmarks like WebVoyager, Online-Mind2Web, and WebTailBench -- our novel benchmark that better captures under-represented web tasks in pre-existing benchmarks. Furthermore, Fara-7B is competitive with much larger frontier models, illustrating key benefits of scalable data generation systems in advancing small efficient agentic models. We are making Fara-7B open-weight on Microsoft Foundry and HuggingFace, and we are releasing WebTailBench.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FISCAL framework generates synthetic financial data to train MiniCheck-FISCAL, a lightweight verifier that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for financial fact-checking while being 20x smaller than larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs for financial applications suffer from hallucination issues and computational inefficiency due to large model sizes, requiring a more reliable and efficient solution.

Method: Proposed FISCAL framework for generating synthetic financial data, then used this data to train MiniCheck-FISCAL - a lightweight verifier for numerical financial claims.

Result: MiniCheck-FISCAL outperforms GPT-3.5 Turbo and similar-sized open-source models, approaches accuracy of much larger systems (20x), and rivals GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 on external datasets while being more efficient.

Conclusion: Domain-specific synthetic data combined with efficient fine-tuning enables compact models to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness, and scalability for practical financial AI applications.

Abstract: Financial applications of large language models (LLMs) require factual reliability and computational efficiency, yet current systems often hallucinate details and depend on prohibitively large models. We propose FISCAL (Financial Synthetic Claim-Document Augmented Learning), a modular framework for generating synthetic data tailored to financial fact-checking. Using FISCAL, we generate a dataset called FISCAL-data and use it to train MiniCheck-FISCAL, a lightweight verifier for numerical financial claims. MiniCheck-FISCAL outperforms its baseline, surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo and other open-source peers of similar size, and approaches the accuracy of much larger systems (20x), such as Mixtral-8x22B and Command R+. On external datasets FinDVer and Fin-Fact, it rivals GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 while outperforming Gemini-1.5 Flash. These results show that domain-specific synthetic data, combined with efficient fine-tuning, enables compact models to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness, and scalability for practical financial AI. The dataset and scripts are available in the project repository (link provided in the paper).

*Farzan Karimi-Malekabadi,Pooya Razavi,Sonya Powers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can effectively accelerate educational assessment item alignment reviews, achieving 83-94% accuracy in identifying misalignments and over 95% success in candidate skill filtering, while reducing manual workload.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional human alignment reviews for educational assessment items are accurate but slow and labor-intensive, especially for large item banks. There's a need to accelerate this process while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Tested three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o) on 12,000+ K-5 item-skill pairs across three tasks: identifying misaligned items, selecting correct skills from standards, and candidate list filtering before classification.

Result: GPT-4o-mini achieved 83-94% accuracy in identifying alignment status, including subtle misalignments. Performance was strong in math but lower in reading due to semantic overlap. Pre-filtering candidate skills improved results significantly, with correct skill appearing in top five suggestions over 95% of the time.

Conclusion: LLMs, especially when combined with candidate filtering strategies, can significantly reduce manual review burden while preserving alignment accuracy. Hybrid pipelines combining LLM-based screening with human review for ambiguous cases offer scalable solutions for item validation and instructional alignment.

Abstract: As educational systems evolve, ensuring that assessment items remain aligned with content standards is essential for maintaining fairness and instructional relevance. Traditional human alignment reviews are accurate but slow and labor-intensive, especially across large item banks. This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate this process without sacrificing accuracy. Using over 12,000 item-skill pairs in grades K-5, we tested three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o) across three tasks that mirror real-world challenges: identifying misaligned items, selecting the correct skill from the full set of standards, and narrowing candidate lists prior to classification. In Study 1, GPT-4o-mini correctly identified alignment status in approximately 83-94% of cases, including subtle misalignments. In Study 2, performance remained strong in mathematics but was lower for reading, where standards are more semantically overlapping. Study 3 demonstrated that pre-filtering candidate skills substantially improved results, with the correct skill appearing among the top five suggestions more than 95% of the time. These findings suggest that LLMs, particularly when paired with candidate filtering strategies, can significantly reduce the manual burden of item review while preserving alignment accuracy. We recommend the development of hybrid pipelines that combine LLM-based screening with human review in ambiguous cases, offering a scalable solution for ongoing item validation and instructional alignment.

TL;DR: VISTA-Gym is a scalable training environment that enables visual agentic reinforcement learning for vision-language models, allowing them to reason through multi-step visual interactions using tools like grounding and parsing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models have strong image understanding but limited ability to perform multi-step visual reasoning and tool integration, struggling with tool selection, invocation, and coordination.

Method: VISTA-Gym provides a standardized interface for visual tools, executable interaction loops, verifiable feedback, and trajectory logging. VISTA-R1 is trained using multi-turn trajectory sampling and end-to-end reinforcement learning to interleave tool-use with agentic reasoning.

Result: VISTA-R1-8B outperforms state-of-the-art baselines of similar size by 9.51%-18.72% across 11 public reasoning-intensive VQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: VISTA-Gym effectively unlocks tool-integrated reasoning capabilities for vision-language models through scalable visual agentic reinforcement learning.

Abstract: While recent vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong image understanding, their ability to "think with images", i.e., to reason through multi-step visual interactions, remains limited. We introduce VISTA-Gym, a scalable training environment for incentivizing tool-integrated visual reasoning capabilities in VLMs. VISTA-Gym unifies diverse real-world multimodal reasoning tasks (7 tasks from 13 datasets in total) with a standardized interface for visual tools (e.g., grounding, parsing), executable interaction loops, verifiable feedback signals, and efficient trajectory logging, enabling visual agentic reinforcement learning at scale. While recent VLMs exhibit strong text-only reasoning, both proprietary and open-source models still struggle with tool selection, invocation, and coordination. With VISTA-Gym, we train VISTA-R1 to interleave tool-use with agentic reasoning via multi-turn trajectory sampling and end-to-end reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across 11 public reasoning-intensive VQA benchmarks show that VISTA-R1-8B outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with similar sizes by 9.51%-18.72%, demonstrating VISTA-Gym as an effective training ground to unlock the tool-integrated reasoning capabilities for VLMs.

TL;DR: A neuro-symbolic framework that integrates structured intent ontology with compact language models for multi-intent understanding in mobile AI agents, achieving near-GPT-4 accuracy with significantly lower computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate and efficient on-device natural language understanding by combining symbolic intent structure with compact language models, addressing the computational limitations of large models while maintaining high accuracy.

Method: Uses retrieval-augmented prompting, logit biasing, and optional classification heads to inject symbolic intent structure into both input and output representations. Integrates a structured intent ontology with compact language models (3B Llama model).

Result: The 3B Llama model with ontology augmentation achieves 85% accuracy compared to GPT-4's 90% on MultiWOZ 2.3 ambiguous dialogues, while using a tiny fraction of the energy and memory footprint. Introduces Semantic Intent Similarity (SIS) metric based on hierarchical ontology depth.

Conclusion: Symbolic alignment is an effective strategy for enabling accurate and efficient on-device NLU, with ontology-augmented models producing more grounded and disambiguated multi-intent interpretations.

Abstract: We introduce a neuro-symbolic framework for multi-intent understanding in mobile AI agents by integrating a structured intent ontology with compact language models. Our method leverages retrieval-augmented prompting, logit biasing and optional classification heads to inject symbolic intent structure into both input and output representations. We formalize a new evaluation metric-Semantic Intent Similarity (SIS)-based on hierarchical ontology depth, capturing semantic proximity even when predicted intents differ lexically. Experiments on a subset of ambiguous/demanding dialogues of MultiWOZ 2.3 (with oracle labels from GPT-o3) demonstrate that a 3B Llama model with ontology augmentation approaches GPT-4 accuracy (85% vs 90%) at a tiny fraction of the energy and memory footprint. Qualitative comparisons show that ontology-augmented models produce more grounded, disambiguated multi-intent interpretations. Our results validate symbolic alignment as an effective strategy for enabling accurate and efficient on-device NLU.

TL;DR: KOM is a multi-agent AI system for automated knee osteoarthritis management that reduces diagnostic time by 38.5% and improves treatment quality when collaborating with clinicians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of implementing personalized KOA interventions in resource-limited settings by automating evaluation, risk prediction, and treatment prescription.

Method: Developed a multi-agent system that assists clinicians across the KOA care pathway and generates tailored management plans based on patient profiles, disease status, risk factors, and contraindications.

Result: KOM outperformed general-purpose LLMs in imaging analysis and prescription generation, and collaboration with clinicians reduced diagnostic time by 38.5% while improving treatment quality.

Conclusion: KOM facilitates automated KOA management and enhances care efficiency in clinical workflows, with potential applications for other chronic conditions through its modular architecture.

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) affects more than 600 million individuals globally and is associated with significant pain, functional impairment, and disability. While personalized multidisciplinary interventions have the potential to slow disease progression and enhance quality of life, they typically require substantial medical resources and expertise, making them difficult to implement in resource-limited settings. To address this challenge, we developed KOM, a multi-agent system designed to automate KOA evaluation, risk prediction, and treatment prescription. This system assists clinicians in performing essential tasks across the KOA care pathway and supports the generation of tailored management plans based on individual patient profiles, disease status, risk factors, and contraindications. In benchmark experiments, KOM demonstrated superior performance compared to several general-purpose large language models in imaging analysis and prescription generation. A randomized three-arm simulation study further revealed that collaboration between KOM and clinicians reduced total diagnostic and planning time by 38.5% and resulted in improved treatment quality compared to each approach used independently. These findings indicate that KOM could help facilitate automated KOA management and, when integrated into clinical workflows, has the potential to enhance care efficiency. The modular architecture of KOM may also offer valuable insights for developing AI-assisted management systems for other chronic conditions.

*Ke Chen,Yifeng Wang,Hassan Almosapeeh,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified prompt evaluation framework and an evaluation-instructed optimization pipeline that achieves superior performance over existing methods across multiple datasets and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt optimization methods are ineffective in complex scenarios, rely on unstable feedback, and lack a systematic definition of prompt quality, leading to fragmented evaluation signals.

Method: Develops a systematic prompt evaluation framework and fine-tunes an execution-free evaluator to predict multi-dimensional quality scores, which then instructs a metric-aware optimizer for interpretable, query-dependent prompt rewriting.

Result: The evaluator achieves the strongest accuracy in predicting prompt performance, and the optimization pipeline consistently surpasses both static-template and query-dependent baselines across eight datasets and three backbone models.

Conclusion: The proposed unified, metric-grounded perspective on prompt quality enables stable, interpretable, and model-agnostic improvements across diverse tasks through evaluation-instructed optimization.

Abstract: Most prompt-optimization methods refine a single static template, making them ineffective in complex and dynamic user scenarios. Existing query-dependent approaches rely on unstable textual feedback or black-box reward models, providing weak and uninterpretable optimization signals. More fundamentally, prompt quality itself lacks a unified, systematic definition, resulting in fragmented and unreliable evaluation signals. Our approach first establishes a performance-oriented, systematic, and comprehensive prompt evaluation framework. Furthermore, we develop and finetune an execution-free evaluator that predicts multi-dimensional quality scores directly from text. The evaluator then instructs a metric-aware optimizer that diagnoses failure modes and rewrites prompts in an interpretable, query-dependent manner. Our evaluator achieves the strongest accuracy in predicting prompt performance, and the evaluation-instructed optimization consistently surpass both static-template and query-dependent baselines across eight datasets and on three backbone models. Overall, we propose a unified, metric-grounded perspective on prompt quality, and demonstrated that our evaluation-instructed optimization pipeline delivers stable, interpretable, and model-agnostic improvements across diverse tasks.

*Dominik Wagner,Leon Witzman,Luke Ong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper combines ω-regular objectives with explicit constraints in reinforcement learning to address limitations of scalar rewards and enable separate treatment of safety requirements and optimization targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL relies on scalar rewards with limited expressiveness for temporal, conditional, or safety-critical goals, leading to reward hacking. Single scalar performance measures also mask important safety-performance trade-offs.

Method: Developed a model-based RL algorithm based on linear programming that produces policies maximizing ω-regular objective satisfaction probability while adhering to ω-regular constraints within specified thresholds. Also established translation to constrained limit-average problems.

Result: The algorithm produces policies that maximize probability of satisfying ω-regular objectives while maintaining ω-regular constraints within specified thresholds, with optimality-preserving guarantees.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses limitations of scalar rewards by combining ω-regular objectives with explicit constraints, enabling separate treatment of safety and optimization goals while preserving optimality guarantees.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) commonly relies on scalar rewards with limited ability to express temporal, conditional, or safety-critical goals, and can lead to reward hacking. Temporal logic expressible via the more general class of $ω$-regular objectives addresses this by precisely specifying rich behavioural properties. Even still, measuring performance by a single scalar (be it reward or satisfaction probability) masks safety-performance trade-offs that arise in settings with a tolerable level of risk.
  We address both limitations simultaneously by combining $ω$-regular objectives with explicit constraints, allowing safety requirements and optimisation targets to be treated separately. We develop a model-based RL algorithm based on linear programming, which in the limit produces a policy maximising the probability of satisfying an $ω$-regular objective while also adhering to $ω$-regular constraints within specified thresholds. Furthermore, we establish a translation to constrained limit-average problems with optimality-preserving guarantees.

Result: Interactive simulations can improve conceptual understanding by 30-40% compared to traditional instruction, while addressing cost and accessibility barriers.

Conclusion: MicroSims has significant implications for educational equity and enables low-cost intelligent interactive textbooks, with potential for future AI-powered adaptive learning systems.

Abstract: Educational simulations have long been recognized as powerful tools for enhancing learning outcomes, yet their creation has traditionally required substantial resources and technical expertise. This paper introduces MicroSims a novel framework for creating lightweight, interactive educational simulations that can be rapidly generated using artificial intelligence, universally embedded across digital learning platforms, and easily customized without programming knowledge. MicroSims occupy a unique position at the intersection of three key innovations: (1) standardized design patterns that enable AI-assisted generation, (2) iframe-based architecture that provides universal embedding and sandboxed security, and (3) transparent, modifiable code that supports customization and pedagogical transparency. We present a comprehensive framework encompassing design principles, technical architecture, metadata standards, and development workflows. Drawing on empirical research from physics education studies and meta-analyses across STEM disciplines, we demonstrate that interactive simulations can improve conceptual understanding by up to 30-40\% compared to traditional instruction. MicroSims extend these benefits while addressing persistent barriers of cost, technical complexity, and platform dependence. This work has significant implications for educational equity, and low-cost intelligent interactive textbooks that enabling educators worldwide to create customized, curriculum-aligned simulations on demand. We discuss implementation considerations, present evidence of effectiveness, and outline future directions for AI-powered adaptive learning systems built on the MicroSim foundation.

Result: Simulation results in post-earthquake rescue scenarios show CC-EIN achieves 95.4% task completion rate, 95% transmission efficiency, while maintaining strong semantic consistency and energy efficiency.

Conclusion: CC-EIN effectively addresses the limitations of existing systems by providing a comprehensive framework for semantic collaboration among multiple embodied intelligent devices, demonstrating superior performance in complex rescue scenarios.

Abstract: In the 6G era, semantic collaboration among multiple embodied intelligent devices (MEIDs) becomes crucial for complex task execution. However, existing systems face challenges in multimodal information fusion, adaptive communication, and decision interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a collaborative Conversational Embodied Intelligence Network (CC-EIN) integrating multimodal feature fusion, adaptive semantic communication, task coordination, and interpretability. PerceptiNet performs cross-modal fusion of image and radar data to generate unified semantic representations. An adaptive semantic communication strategy dynamically adjusts coding schemes and transmission power according to task urgency and channel quality. A semantic-driven collaboration mechanism further supports task decomposition and conflict-free coordination among heterogeneous devices. Finally, the InDec module enhances decision transparency through Grad-CAM visualization. Simulation results in post-earthquake rescue scenarios demonstrate that CC-EIN achieves 95.4% task completion rate and 95% transmission efficiency while maintaining strong semantic consistency and energy efficiency.

*Daniel I Jackson,Emma L Jensen,Syed-Amad Hussain,Emre Sezgin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show stable but inaccurate self-assessments across different tasks, with self-efficacy scores not reliably reflecting actual performance capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' self-assessment capabilities using psychometric measures, moving beyond traditional task accuracy metrics to understand how models perceive their own abilities.

Method: Adapted the 10-item General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) to test ten LLMs across four conditions: no task, computational reasoning, social reasoning, and summarization, with follow-up confidence prompts.

Result: Models showed stable GSES responses but significantly different self-efficacy levels across conditions, with scores lower than human norms. Self-assessment didn't correlate with actual performance - some low-scoring models performed well while high-scoring ones performed poorly.

Conclusion: Psychometric prompting provides insight into LLM communication styles but not calibrated performance estimates, revealing that self-efficacy scores reflect communication behavior rather than actual capability.

Abstract: Self-assessment is a key aspect of reliable intelligence, yet evaluations of large language models (LLMs) focus mainly on task accuracy. We adapted the 10-item General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) to elicit simulated self-assessments from ten LLMs across four conditions: no task, computational reasoning, social reasoning, and summarization. GSES responses were highly stable across repeated administrations and randomized item orders. However, models showed significantly different self-efficacy levels across conditions, with aggregate scores lower than human norms. All models achieved perfect accuracy on computational and social questions, whereas summarization performance varied widely. Self-assessment did not reliably reflect ability: several low-scoring models performed accurately, while some high-scoring models produced weaker summaries. Follow-up confidence prompts yielded modest, mostly downward revisions, suggesting mild overestimation in first-pass assessments. Qualitative analysis showed that higher self-efficacy corresponded to more assertive, anthropomorphic reasoning styles, whereas lower scores reflected cautious, de-anthropomorphized explanations. Psychometric prompting provides structured insight into LLM communication behavior but not calibrated performance estimates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree search-based methods for code generation face challenges in evaluating intermediate algorithmic steps and correcting errors timely, leading to incorrect code and high computational costs.

Method: RPM-MCTS uses Knowledge-Retrieval as Process Reward Model with Monte Carlo Tree Search, employs similarity filtering to remove redundant nodes, and utilizes sandbox execution feedback to locate and correct erroneous steps during generation.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public code generation benchmarks show RPM-MCTS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods while achieving approximately 15% reduction in token consumption.

Conclusion: RPM-MCTS effectively enhances code generation capabilities and full fine-tuning of the base model using RPM-MCTS constructed data significantly improves code capabilities.

Abstract: Tree search-based methods have made significant progress in enhancing the code generation capabilities of large language models. However, due to the difficulty in effectively evaluating intermediate algorithmic steps and the inability to locate and timely correct erroneous steps, these methods often generate incorrect code and incur increased computational costs. To tackle these problems, we propose RPM-MCTS, an effective method that utilizes Knowledge-Retrieval as Process Reward Model based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to evaluate intermediate algorithmic steps. By utilizing knowledge base retrieval, RPM-MCTS avoids the complex training of process reward models. During the expansion phase, similarity filtering is employed to remove redundant nodes, ensuring diversity in reasoning paths. Furthermore, our method utilizes sandbox execution feedback to locate erroneous algorithmic steps during generation, enabling timely and targeted corrections. Extensive experiments on four public code generation benchmarks demonstrate that RPM-MCTS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods while achieving an approximately 15% reduction in token consumption. Furthermore, full fine-tuning of the base model using the data constructed by RPM-MCTS significantly enhances its code capabilities.

*Qiyao Wei,Edward Morrell,Lea Goetz,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a knowledge graph-based method to generate benchmarks for evaluating semantic similarity methods in LLM outputs, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks like high cost and domain specificity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantic similarity evaluation methods for LLMs may prioritize syntactic/lexical features over semantic content, and existing benchmarks have limitations including high human judgment costs, limited domain availability, and unclear equivalence definitions.

Method: The approach uses knowledge graphs to generate natural-language statement pairs that are semantically similar or dissimilar, with dissimilar pairs categorized into four sub-types. Benchmarks are created across four domains: general knowledge, biomedicine, finance, and biology.

Result: The study found that semantic variation sub-types and benchmark domains significantly impact semantic similarity method performance, with no single method consistently outperforming others. LLM-as-a-judge approaches show important limitations in detecting semantic content.

Conclusion: The proposed knowledge graph-based benchmark generation method effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches and reveals domain-specific and variation-type-dependent performance patterns in semantic similarity evaluation methods.

Abstract: Evaluating the open-form textual responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) typically requires measuring the semantic similarity of the response to a (human generated) reference. However, there is evidence that current semantic similarity methods may capture syntactic or lexical forms over semantic content. While benchmarks exist for semantic equivalence, they often suffer from high generation costs due to reliance on subjective human judgment, limited availability for domain-specific applications, and unclear definitions of equivalence. This paper introduces a novel method for generating benchmarks to evaluate semantic similarity methods for LLM outputs, specifically addressing these limitations. Our approach leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate pairs of natural-language statements that are semantically similar or dissimilar, with dissimilar pairs categorized into one of four sub-types. We generate benchmark datasets in four different domains (general knowledge, biomedicine, finance, biology), and conduct a comparative study of semantic similarity methods including traditional natural language processing scores and LLM-as-a-judge predictions. We observe that the sub-type of semantic variation, as well as the domain of the benchmark impact the performance of semantic similarity methods, with no method being consistently superior. Our results present important implications for the use of LLM-as-a-judge in detecting the semantic content of text.

Motivation: LLMs are being rapidly integrated into production systems but their failure patterns differ fundamentally from traditional ML models, and their behavior in production environments remains poorly understood.

Method: The authors develop a system-level taxonomy of fifteen hidden failure modes in LLM applications and analyze current evaluation and monitoring practices to identify gaps.

Result: Identified key failure modes including multi-step reasoning drift, latent inconsistency, context-boundary degradation, incorrect tool invocation, version drift, and cost-driven performance collapse. Found growing gaps in evaluation practices that don't address stability, reproducibility, drift, or workflow integration.

Conclusion: LLM reliability should be framed as a system-engineering problem rather than purely model-centric, providing foundation for future research on evaluation methodology, AI system robustness, and dependable LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being rapidly integrated into decision-support tools, automation workflows, and AI-enabled software systems. However, their behavior in production environments remains poorly understood, and their failure patterns differ fundamentally from those of traditional machine learning models. This paper presents a system-level taxonomy of fifteen hidden failure modes that arise in real-world LLM applications, including multi-step reasoning drift, latent inconsistency, context-boundary degradation, incorrect tool invocation, version drift, and cost-driven performance collapse. Using this taxonomy, we analyze the growing gap in evaluation and monitoring practices: existing benchmarks measure knowledge or reasoning but provide little insight into stability, reproducibility, drift, or workflow integration. We further examine the production challenges associated with deploying LLMs - including observability limitations, cost constraints, and update-induced regressions - and outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM systems. Finally, we outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM-based systems. By framing LLM reliability as a system-engineering problem rather than a purely model-centric one, this work provides an analytical foundation for future research on evaluation methodology, AI system robustness, and dependable LLM deployment.

*Weizi Shao,Taolin Zhang,Zijie Zhou,Chen Chen,Chengyu Wang,Xiaofeng He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: M$^3$Prune is a multi-modal multi-agent hierarchical communication graph pruning framework that reduces token overhead and computational costs in multi-modal RAG systems by eliminating redundant edges across modalities while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent mRAG systems suffer from substantial token overhead and increased computational costs, making large-scale deployment challenging despite their impressive performance through collective intelligence.

Method: The framework applies intra-modal graph sparsification to identify critical edges in textual and visual modalities, constructs a dynamic communication topology using these key edges for inter-modal sparsification, and progressively prunes redundant edges to create an efficient hierarchical topology.

Result: Extensive experiments on general and domain-specific mRAG benchmarks show that M$^3$Prune consistently outperforms both single-agent and robust multi-agent mRAG systems while significantly reducing token consumption.

Conclusion: M$^3$Prune achieves an optimal balance between task performance and token overhead by eliminating redundant communication edges across modalities, enabling more efficient and scalable multi-modal multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation (mRAG), which enhance multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) with external knowledge, have demonstrated that the collective intelligence of multiple agents can significantly outperform a single model through effective communication. Despite impressive performance, existing multi-agent systems inherently incur substantial token overhead and increased computational costs, posing challenges for large-scale deployment. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-agent hierarchical communication graph PRUNING framework, termed M$^3$Prune. Our framework eliminates redundant edges across different modalities, achieving an optimal balance between task performance and token overhead. Specifically, M$^3$Prune first applies intra-modal graph sparsification to textual and visual modalities, identifying the edges most critical for solving the task. Subsequently, we construct a dynamic communication topology using these key edges for inter-modal graph sparsification. Finally, we progressively prune redundant edges to obtain a more efficient and hierarchical topology. Extensive experiments on both general and domain-specific mRAG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single-agent and robust multi-agent mRAG systems while significantly reducing token consumption.

### [45] [Reducing Latency of LLM Search Agent via Speculation-based Algorithm-System Co-Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20048)
*Zixiao Huang,Wen Zeng,Tianyu Fu,Tengxuan Liu,Yizhou Sun,Ke Hong,Xinhao Yang,Chengchun Liu,Yan Li,Quanlu Zhang,Guohao Dai,Zhenhua Zhu,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPAgent is an algorithm-system co-design framework that uses adaptive speculation to reduce latency in LLM-based search agents by predicting simple evidence-gathering actions without full reasoning, achieving up to 1.65× speedup while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based search agents suffer from severe latency due to serialized LLM reasoning and tool execution at each step, limiting their practical deployment despite strong performance.

Method: SPAgent introduces a two-phase adaptive speculation mechanism that selectively omits verification when safe, combined with a two-level scheduler that regulates speculative requests based on engine load.

Result: SPAgent achieves up to 1.65× end-to-end speedup across extensive experimental settings while maintaining the same or even achieving higher accuracy compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The framework enables practical deployment of multi-step search agents by effectively reducing latency through speculation while preserving or enhancing performance.

Abstract: LLM-based search agents achieve strong performance but suffer from severe latency, as each step requires serialized LLM reasoning followed by action of tool execution. We revisit this bottleneck through the lens of speculation. While traditional predict-verify speculation paradigm can break serial execution, its benefit remains limited, as it retains the full original workload and adds extra inference overhead. We observe that early agent steps often involve simple evidence-gathering, where correct actions can often be predicted without full reasoning. Building on these observations, we present SPAgent, an algorithm-system co-design framework that expands the role of speculation in search agents to reduce latency. Algorithmically, SPAgent introduces a two-phase adaptive speculation mechanism that selectively omits verification when safe. System-wise, a two-level scheduler regulates speculative requests based on engine load to ensure speculation remains beneficial. We implement SPAgent in real-world systems. Across extensive experimental settings, SPAgent achieves up to $1.65\times$ end-to-end speedup while maintaining same or even achieving higher accuracy, enabling practical deployment of multi-step search agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing navigation benchmarks focus only on task success metrics while overlooking economic viability, which is critical for commercial deployment of autonomous delivery robots.

Method: CostNav models the complete economic lifecycle including hardware, training, energy, maintenance costs, and delivery revenue with service-level agreements, using industry-derived parameters and projecting from reduced-scale simulation to realistic deliveries.

Result: The baseline achieves 43.0% SLA compliance but is not commercially viable, yielding a loss of $30.009 per run with no finite break-even point, with collision-induced maintenance accounting for 99.7% of per-run costs.

Conclusion: CostNav bridges the gap between navigation research and commercial deployment, enabling data-driven decisions about economic trade-offs across navigation paradigms and highlighting collision avoidance as a key optimization target.

Abstract: Existing navigation benchmarks focus on task success metrics while overlooking economic viability -- critical for commercial deployment of autonomous delivery robots. We introduce \emph{CostNav}, a \textbf{Micro-Navigation Economic Testbed} that evaluates embodied agents through comprehensive cost-revenue analysis aligned with real-world business operations. CostNav models the complete economic lifecycle including hardware, training, energy, maintenance costs, and delivery revenue with service-level agreements, using industry-derived parameters. \textbf{To our knowledge, CostNav is the first work to quantitatively expose the gap between navigation research metrics and commercial viability}, revealing that optimizing for task success fundamentally differs from optimizing for economic deployment. Our cost model uses parameters derived from industry data sources (energy rates, delivery service pricing), and we project from a reduced-scale simulation to realistic deliveries. Under this projection, the baseline achieves 43.0\% SLA compliance but is \emph{not} commercially viable: yielding a loss of \$30.009 per run with no finite break-even point, because operating costs are dominated by collision-induced maintenance, which accounts for 99.7\% of per-run costs and highlights collision avoidance as a key optimization target. We demonstrate a learning-based on-device navigation baseline and establish a foundation for evaluating rule-based navigation, imitation learning, and cost-aware RL training. CostNav bridges the gap between navigation research and commercial deployment, enabling data-driven decisions about economic trade-offs across navigation paradigms.

Conclusion: DANCE effectively addresses key limitations in existing algorithms by balancing plausibility, diversity, and sparsity while ensuring counterfactuals align with real-world constraints and dependencies.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations enhance the actionable interpretability of machine learning models by identifying the minimal changes required to achieve a desired outcome of the model. However, existing methods often ignore the complex dependencies in real-world datasets, leading to unrealistic or impractical modifications. Motivated by cybersecurity applications in the email marketing domain, we propose a method for generating Diverse, Actionable, and kNowledge-Constrained Explanations (DANCE), which incorporates feature dependencies and causal constraints to ensure plausibility and real-world feasibility of counterfactuals. Our method learns linear and nonlinear constraints from data or integrates expert-provided dependency graphs, ensuring counterfactuals are plausible and actionable. By maintaining consistency with feature relationships, the method produces explanations that align with real-world constraints. Additionally, it balances plausibility, diversity, and sparsity, effectively addressing key limitations in existing algorithms. The work is developed based on a real-life case study with Freshmail, the largest email marketing company in Poland and supported by a joint R&D project Sendguard. Furthermore, we provide an extensive evaluation using 140 public datasets, which highlights its ability to generate meaningful, domain-relevant counterfactuals that outperform other existing approaches based on widely used metrics.

*Shashank Kirtania,Param Biyani,Priyanshu Gupta,Yasharth Bajpai,Roshni Iyer,Sumit Gulwani,Gustavo Soares*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BREW is a framework that optimizes LLM-based agents through structured memory construction and refinement, achieving improved task precision and efficiency while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to base models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training paradigms for LLM-based agents (PPO, GRPO) have high computational overhead and produce opaque policies that are difficult to interpret, adapt, or incrementally improve.

Method: BREW creates and refines structured memory of experiential learning through KB construction and refinement, using task graders, behavior rubrics, and state-space search for robustness against natural language noise.

Result: BREW achieves 10-20% improvement in task precision, 10-15% reduction in API/tool calls leading to faster execution time, while maintaining computational efficiency on par with base models on real-world benchmarks (OSWorld, τ²Bench, SpreadsheetBench).

Conclusion: BREW establishes knowledge bases as modular and controllable substrates for agent optimization - an explicit lever for shaping behavior in a transparent, interpretable, and extensible manner, unlike prior static memory approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly applied to tasks requiring structured reasoning, tool use, and environmental adaptation, such as data manipulation, multistep planning, and computer-use automation. However, despite their versatility, current training paradigms for model weight optimization methods, like PPO and GRPO, remain relatively impractical with their high computational overhead for rollout convergence. In addition, the resulting agent policies are difficult to interpret, adapt, or incrementally improve. To address this, we investigate creating and refining structured memory of experiential learning of an agent from its environment as an alternative route to agent optimization. We introduce BREW (Bootstrapping expeRientially-learned Environmental knoWledge), a framework for agent optimization for downstream tasks via KB construction and refinement. In our formulation, we introduce an effective method for partitioning agent memory for more efficient retrieval and refinement. BREW uses task graders and behavior rubrics to learn insights while leveraging state-space search for ensuring robustness from the noise and non-specificity in natural language. Empirical results on real world, domain-grounded benchmarks -- OSWorld, $τ^2$Bench, and SpreadsheetBench -- show BREW achieves $10-20\%$ improvement in task precision, $10-15\%$ reduction in API/tool calls leading to faster execution time, all while maintaining computational efficiency on par with base models. Unlike prior work where memory is treated as static context, we establish the KB as a modular and controllable substrate for agent optimization -- an explicit lever for shaping behavior in a transparent, interpretable, and extensible manner.

*Alexander Beiser,Flavio Martinelli,Wulfram Gerstner,Johanni Brea*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of reverse-engineering neural network weights when teacher parameters outnumber training data. It introduces novel data augmentation techniques to better sample hidden layer representations, enabling recovery of networks with up to 100x more parameters than training samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to reverse-engineer network weights when teacher parameters exceed training data because students overfit to queries instead of aligning parameters. Standard augmentations like rotation and flipping provide little improvement for this identification problem.

Method: The authors design new data augmentation techniques specifically tailored to better sample the representational space of network hidden layers, going beyond standard augmentations like rotation, flipping, and noise addition.

Result: With the new augmentations, the method extends the state-of-the-art range of recoverable network sizes and can recover networks with up to 100 times more parameters than training data-points.

Conclusion: Custom-designed data augmentations that specifically target hidden layer representations are crucial for successfully reverse-engineering network weights when teacher parameters significantly outnumber available training data.

Abstract: Network weights can be reverse-engineered given enough informative samples of a network's input-output function. In a teacher-student setup, this translates into collecting a dataset of the teacher mapping -- querying the teacher -- and fitting a student to imitate such mapping. A sensible choice of queries is the dataset the teacher is trained on. But current methods fail when the teacher parameters are more numerous than the training data, because the student overfits to the queries instead of aligning its parameters to the teacher. In this work, we explore augmentation techniques to best sample the input-output mapping of a teacher network, with the goal of eliciting a rich set of representations from the teacher hidden layers. We discover that standard augmentations such as rotation, flipping, and adding noise, bring little to no improvement to the identification problem. We design new data augmentation techniques tailored to better sample the representational space of the network's hidden layers. With our augmentations we extend the state-of-the-art range of recoverable network sizes. To test their scalability, we show that we can recover networks of up to 100 times more parameters than training data-points.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the concept of active inference by separating it from the Free Energy Principle and provide alternative mathematical formulations.

Method: Formulate active inference optimizations as constrained divergence minimization problems using standard mean field methods, with different criteria for perception (variational free energy) and action (differing from expected free energy by an entropy regularizer).

Result: Successfully demonstrated that active inference can be implemented without appealing to expected free energy, using divergence minimization approaches that coincide with variational free energy for perception and differ by an entropy term for action.

Conclusion: Active inference can be conceptually and mathematically separated from the Free Energy Principle, with alternative formulations that maintain computational tractability while providing theoretical clarity.

Abstract: We seek to clarify the concept of active inference by disentangling it from the Free Energy Principle. We show how the optimizations that need to be carried out in order to implement active inference in discrete state spaces can be formulated as constrained divergence minimization problems which can be solved by standard mean field methods that do not appeal to the idea of expected free energy. When it is used to model perception, the perception/action divergence criterion that we propose coincides with variational free energy. When it is used to model action, it differs from an expected free energy functional by an entropy regularizer.

Conclusion: NNGPT successfully demonstrates autonomous AutoML capabilities, matching search-based approaches with one-shot prediction and establishing a self-improving system for neural network development that will be publicly released for community use.

Abstract: Building self-improving AI systems remains a fundamental challenge in the AI domain. We present NNGPT, an open-source framework that turns a large language model (LLM) into a self-improving AutoML engine for neural network development, primarily for computer vision. Unlike previous frameworks, NNGPT extends the dataset of neural networks by generating new models, enabling continuous fine-tuning of LLMs based on closed-loop system of generation, assessment, and self-improvement. It integrates within one unified workflow five synergistic LLM-based pipelines: zero-shot architecture synthesis, hyperparameter optimization (HPO), code-aware accuracy/early-stop prediction, retrieval-augmented synthesis of scope-closed PyTorch blocks (NN-RAG), and reinforcement learning. Built on the LEMUR dataset as an audited corpus with reproducible metrics, NNGPT emits from a single prompt and validates network architecture, preprocessing code, and hyperparameters, executes them end-to-end, and learns from result. The PyTorch adapter makes NNGPT framework-agnostic, enabling strong performance: NN-RAG achieves 73% executability on 1,289 targets, 3-shot prompting boosts accuracy on common datasets, and hash-based deduplication saves hundreds of runs. One-shot prediction matches search-based AutoML, reducing the need for numerous trials. HPO on LEMUR achieves RMSE 0.60, outperforming Optuna (0.64), while the code-aware predictor reaches RMSE 0.14 with Pearson r=0.78. The system has already generated over 5K validated models, proving NNGPT as an autonomous AutoML engine. Upon acceptance, the code, prompts, and checkpoints will be released for public access to enable reproducibility and facilitate community usage.

TL;DR: VibraVerse is a large-scale dataset that bridges 3D geometry, physical properties, and acoustic signals through modal analysis, enabling physically consistent multimodal learning between shape, image, and sound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal frameworks lack physical consistency and ignore causal relationships between object geometry, material properties, vibration modes, and resulting sounds, limiting their ability to understand the physical world.

Method: Created VibraVerse dataset with explicit physical properties and volumetric geometry, computed modal parameters, and synthesized impact sounds. Introduced CLASP contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment preserving causal correspondence between physical structure and acoustic response.

Result: Models trained on VibraVerse demonstrate superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning tasks.

Conclusion: VibraVerse establishes a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing foundations for sound-guided embodied perception and deeper understanding of physical world relationships.

Abstract: Understanding the physical world requires perceptual models grounded in physical laws rather than mere statistical correlations. However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -> physical attributes -> modal parameters -> acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world. The dataset will be open-sourced.
